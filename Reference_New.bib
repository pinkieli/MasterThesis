  abstract = {The unified theory developed by Henrici [5] for one-step methods is extended to the more general case where the order of the system of difference equations can exceed the order of the system of ordinary differential equations. The analysis is applicable to every fixed-stepsize fixed-formula method known to the author. For many of these methods the concept of consistency is inadequate. A more appropriate concept, termed quasi-consistency, is introduced. The notion of optimal stability introduced by Spijker [9] is simplified and extended for the special case of step by step methods for ordinary differential equations.},

In this article, the order of convergence of such methods is obtained by defining a sequence of norms associated with an order vector. The order of consistency is defined in terms of these norms and it is shown that this definition is sufficient to establish the order of convergence of conventional stable methods. The general case requires additional properties which are also defined in terms of the norms. Some examples of unconventional methods are given.},

  abstract = {An investigation is made of the nature of asymptotic solutions of homogeneous linear differential equations of arbitrary order in the neighborhood of a singularity of unit rank. We introduce a classification of the solutions into two types, explicit and implicit. For the former there exists a sector on which the solution is dominated by all independent solutions as the singularity is approached. No such sector exists for implicit solutions. In consequence, the two types of solution have different uniqueness properties. Another difference is that error bounds for the asymptotic expansions of explicit solutions are generally stronger than those for implicit solutions. We also investigate the computation of the solutions by numerical integration of the differential equation. It is shown that it is the exception rather than the rule for the integration process to be stable, particularly so for implicit solutions. To overcome these instabilities we develop boundary-value methods, complete with error analysis. Numerical examples illustrate the computation of both explicit and implicit solutions, and also the associated Stokes multipliers.},

  abstract = {Robust and efficient numerical methods are an essential prerequisite for the computer-based dynamical analysis of engineering systems. In vehicle system dynamics, the methods and software tools from multibody system dynamics provide the integration platform for the analysis, simulation and optimisation of the complex dynamical behaviour of vehicles and vehicle components and their interaction with hydraulic components, electronical devices and control structures. Based on the principles of classical mechanics, the modelling of vehicles and their components results in nonlinear systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) or differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) of moderate dimension that describe the dynamical behaviour in the frequency range required and with a level of detail being characteristic of vehicle system dynamics. Most practical problems in this field may be transformed to generic problems of numerical mathematics like systems of nonlinear equations in the (quasi-)static analysis and explicit ODEs or DAEs with a typical semi-explicit structure in the dynamical analysis. This transformation to mathematical standard problems allows to use sophisticated, freely available numerical software that is based on well approved numerical methods like the Newton-Raphson iteration for nonlinear equations or Runge-Kutta and linear multistep methods for ODE/DAE time integration. Substantial speed-ups of these numerical standard methods may be achieved exploiting some specific structure of the mathematical models in vehicle system dynamics. In the present paper, we follow this framework and start with some modelling aspects being relevant from the numerical viewpoint. The focus of the paper is on numerical methods for static and dynamic problems, including software issues and a discussion which method fits best for which class of problems. Adaptive components in state-of-the-art numerical software like stepsize and order control in time integration are introduced and illustrated by a well-known benchmark problem from rail vehicle simulation. Over the last few decades, the complexity of high-end applications in vehicle system dynamics has frequently given a fresh impetus for substantial improvements of numerical methods and for the development of novel methods for new problem classes. In the present paper, we address three of these challenging problems of current interest that are today still beyond the mainstream of numerical mathematics: (i) modelling and simulation of contact problems in multibody dynamics, (ii) real-time capable numerical simulation techniques in vehicle system dynamics and (iii) modelling and time integration of multidisciplinary problems in system dynamics including co-simulation techniques. \&copy; 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

  abstract = {Sophisticated numerical methods must be implemented to solve the large, high dimensional ODE and PDE problems that arise in cardiac electrophysiology. This dissertation examines the nature of these problems and exactly what make them so difficult to solve as well as practical solution strategies that can be successfully applied to the cardiac model and to other problems with similar characteristics. A basic description of the cardiac model is presented along with an overview of some of the currently used solution techniques. The drawbacks of the currently used methods will motivate the advanced schemes developed here. The general framework for solving the reaction-diffusion PDE is operator splitting which gives two subproblems: a system of ODEs and a parabolic PDE. Although others have used this method, the splitting error was unknown and the splitting time step chosen certainly was not optimal. An error analysis will be made for the cardiac model to show the accuracy even with a large splitting step to allow for flexibility in choosing ODE and PDE time steps. In particular, it will allow small adaptive time stepping to be used for the ODE while a much larger time step is used for the PDE. It will be shown that the cardiac ODE suffers from two serious complications: stiffness and steep gradients in the solution. A highly efficient implicit adaptive solver is developed to deal with these issues. The adaptive time step will be based on an error estimate that is efficient for implicit schemes and measured using a novel norm that is weighted in the components that change the most rapidly. Reduced manifold methods are explored as another way to solve the cardiac model and stiff systems of ODEs in general. Stiff ODES define a slow invariant manifold (SIM) in phase space which can be exploited to approximate the solution. A practical reduced manifold method is the intrinsic low dimensional manifold (ILDM) method which approximates the SIM. The full ODE is solved until the solution approaches the manifold; then, an algebraic equation describing the manifold along with a reduced ODE on the manifold are solved. A novel, modified ILDM approach is developed which generalizes the ILDM method to any stiff non-linear system.

  abstract = {Two families of Rothe's methods that are based on the discretization of the time variable and keeping the spatial one continuous for the solution of second-order hyperbolic equations with damping and nonlinear source terms are presented. The first family is based on time integration and results in a Volterra integro-differential equation which, upon approximating certain time integrals, can be written as an ordinary differential equation in space. Upon discretizing the spatial derivatives by means of finite difference formula, this family results in nonlinear algebraic equations which contain exponential terms that depend on the time step, and its accuracy is shown to be lower than that of an explicit second-order accurate discretization in both space and time of second-order hyperbolic equations. The second family of methods is based on the discretization of the time derivatives and time linearization, and results in linear ordinary differential equations in space. Upon freezing the coefficients of these equations, one can integrate analytically the resulting linear ordinary differential equations to obtain piecewise exponential solutions which are continuous in space, and three-point finite difference equations which depend exponentially on the time step, spatial grid size, and the diffusion, relaxation, damping and reaction times. The finite difference equations are shown to result in non-diagonally dominant matrices unless the time step is smaller than the characteristic relaxation, diffusion, damping and reaction times. To avoid this problem, two Rothe's techniques that do not account for the Jacobian of the reaction terms in the ordinary differential operator are developed, and it is shown that the Rothe's techniques belonging to the second family are as accurate as the linearly implicit methods presented in Part I provided that the relaxation time is smaller than the critical time and the solution does not oscillate in space. When the relaxation time is greater than the critical one, Rothe's methods have been found to be less accurate than the finite difference techniques of Part I. The Rothe's techniques belonging to the second family are generalized to systems of nonlinear second-order hyperbolic equations and mixed systems of parabolic and second-order hyperbolic partial differential equations. \&copy; 2007 Elsevier Inc.

  title = {Nodal Integral Methods for the Numerical Solution of the Shallow -Water Equations},
  copyright = {Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.},
  abstract = {A series of new coarse-mesh numerical methods for the solution of the two-dimensional shallow-water equations is developed, first for the beta-plane model and then on the surface of a sphere. As with other methods of this type (so-called "nodal" methods), the partial differential equations are transverse averaged over each computational element or "node," and the ordinary differential equations resulting from this procedure are solved analytically within each element, with the solutions being written in terms of the dependent variables averaged along the element boundaries. The remaining parts of the equations, which are collected in source-like terms, are approximated via low-order expansions to complete the discretization process. The resulting set of nonlinear algebraic equations is solved iteratively using a Newton-Krylov method. Three new methods are developed for the shallow-water model in the beta-plane with a second-order, linear viscosity term. The first method is developed for the steady-state shallow-water model. This method is extended to the time-dependent equations by approximating the temporal derivatives with a simple finite-difference scheme, thereby resulting in a hybrid method combining features from both the nodal integral and finite-difference approaches. Finally, a method is developed for the time-dependent equations by applying the nodal integral approach to both the spatial and temporal terms. Each new method in the beta-plane is applied to several test problems, the analytical solutions of which are available, and the numerical results are compared to these analytical solutions. The third method also is applied to other elementary flow problems for which analytical solutions are not available. The numerical results at several resolutions are compared to demonstrate that the method provides accurate results on coarse meshes. Next, a systematic treatment of the transverse averaging procedure for general orthogonal curvilinear coordinates is developed. This new technique is used to develop a new method for the continuity equation in spherical coordinates which is tested by advecting a test pattern around the surface of a sphere. Finally, a different, new nodal integral method that conserves both mass and absolute vorticity is developed for the inviscid shallow-water equations in spherical coordinates. This method is tested using several selected benchmark problems for this system of equations. The accuracy of the method is discussed and compared to other methods for the shallow-water equations on the sphere.

  issn = {02668920},
  abstract = {In the present work the problem of determining the probabilistic structure of the dynamical response of nonlinear systems subjected to general, external, stochastic excitation is considered. The starting point of our approach is a Hopf-type equation, governing the evolution of the joint, response-excitation, characteristic functional. Exploiting this equation, we derive new linear partial differential equations governing the joint, response-excitation, characteristic (or probability density) function, which can be considered as an extension of the well-known Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation to the case of a general, correlated excitation and, thus, non-Markovian response character. These new equations are supplemented by initial conditions and a marginal compatibility condition (with respect to the known probability distribution of the excitation), which is of non-local character. The validity of this new equation is also checked by showing its equivalence with the infinite system of moment equations. The method is applicable to any differential system, in state-space form, exhibiting polynomial nonlinearities. In this paper the method is illustrated through a detailed analysis of a simple, first-order, scalar equation, with a cubic nonlinearity. It is also shown that various versions of Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation, corresponding to the case of independent-increment excitations, can be derived by using the same approach. A numerical method for the solution of these new equations is introduced and illustrated through its application to the simple model problem. It is based on the representation of the joint probability density (or characteristic) function by means of a convex superposition of kernel functions, which permits us to satisfy a priori the non-local marginal compatibility condition. On the basis of this representation, the partial differential equation is eventually transformed to a system of ordinary differential equations for the kernel parameters. Extension to general, multidimensional, dynamical systems exhibiting any polynomial nonlinearity will be presented in a forthcoming paper. \&copy; 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

To demonstrate the abilities of this formulation, several linear and geometrical nonlinear structures are solved. The outcomes of authors' technique are compared with the ones obtained by other researchers. The findings not only confirm the improved accuracy of the new scheme but also indicate that the suggested method remains stable when the trapezoidal rule fails to produce a stable solution. Effectively maximizing high-frequency numerical dissipation, without inducing excessive algorithmic damping in the important low-frequency region, is one of the proposed tactic merits. Spurious oscillations are removed, and small numerical dispersion error is achieved, when using this approach.},

  abstract = {This article is concerned with developing efficient discontinuous Galerkin methods for approximating viscosity (and classical) solutions of fully nonlinear second-order elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) including the Monge-Ampe\&grave;re equation and the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. A general framework for constructing interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin (IP-DG) methods for these PDEs is presented. The key idea is to introduce multiple discrete Hessians for the viscosity solution as a means to characterize the behavior of the function. The PDE is rewritten in a mixed form composed of a single nonlinear equation paired with a system of linear equations that defines multiple Hessian approximations. To form the single nonlinear equation, the nonlinear PDE operator is replaced by the projection of a numerical operator into the discontinuous Galerkin test space. The numerical operator uses the multiple Hessian approximations to form a numerical moment which fulfills consistency and g-monotonicity requirements of the framework. The numerical moment will be used to design solvers that will be shown to help the IP-DG methods select the "correct" solution that corresponds to the unique viscosity solution. Numerical experiments are also presented to gauge the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed mixed IP-DG methods.Copyright \&copy; 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Thus, the solution also covers the case of internal resonance which is an interesting and important part of non-linear oscillation. The determination of the solution is very simple and easier than the existing procedures developed by several authors (both in methods of averaging and multiple time scales) especially to tackle the case of internal resonance. The method is illustrated by an example of a fourth-order differential equation. The solution shows a good agreement with numerical solution in all of the three cases, e.g. over-damped, damped and undamped. \&copy; 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The past several years have yielded much research into the development of general numerical integrators for nonlinear unstructured higher index differential algebraic equations (DAEs) of the form \$F(y$\backslash$sp$\backslash$prime,y,t)=0\$ where \$F$\backslash$sby$\backslash$sp$\backslash$prime\$ is identically singular. These methods are based on integrating an implicitly defined ODE produced by forming the derivative array equations \$G(y$\backslash$sp$\backslash$prime,w,y,t)=0.\$ This larger nonlinear system may have components that are not uniquely determined. Prior work has examined the theoretical aspects of these methods. There has also been considerable work done on the efficient implementation of these integrators. This thesis will examine two initialization problems that arise when numerically solving DAEs. One problem is the computation of the consistent initial conditions required to begin the integration of DAEs. Various line search strategies will be compared and examples provided showing where these strategies are needed. The second problem is the initialization of the iterative solvers used during the integration of a DAE. Integration of the implicitly defined ODE depends on solving the nonlinear system \$G=0\$ at each time step. For fully implicit nonlinear systems the possible effects of polynomial prediction on the nonunique components will be examined. A complete analysis is given in the case of higher index linear time varying DAEs. It is shown that the standard ODE theory does not hold and a different prediction strategy must be used.

  abstract = {Restricted Item. Print thesis available in the University of Auckland Library or may be available through Inter-Library Loan. A new type of general linear method for the numerical solution of stiff differentialequations has been discovered recently. These methods are characterised by aproperty known as "inherent Runge-Kutta stability". This property implies thatthe stability matrix has only a single non-zero eigenvalue and that this eigenvalueis a rational approximation to the exponential function. This rational approximationis just like the stability function of a Runge-Kutta method. The theoreticalproperties of the new methods, such as stability and order, are surveyed. Alsoconstructing practical general linear methods of this type for stiff problems isdiscussed.The emphasis of the thesis is on implementation and numerical experiments.We have investigated several implementation questions such as starting methods,prediction of the stage values, an efficient iteration scheme, truncation error estimationand stepsize control. For each of these questions, numerical tests havebeen carried out.To investigate a fixed order general linear method, a starting method is neededto provide the first incoming approximations. It is to be expected that a goodprediction of the initial iteration in the Newton method calculations will reducethe number of iterations required. Since the LU factorizations are expensive, wehave designed an efficient iteration scheme to reduce the computational cost. Areliable error estimator gives an optimal stepsize sequence. These implementationissues are addressed in detail.},

Since the Jacobian evaluation and its inversion are expensive, in order to achieve a better computational efficiency, we compute Jacobian and its inverse only once in a single cycle of the proposed multi-step iterative method. Actually the involved systems of linear equations are solved by employing the LU-decomposition, rather than inversion. The primitive iterative method (termed base method) has convergence-order (CO) five and then we describe a matrix polynomial of degree two to design a multi-step method. Each inclusion of single step in the base method will increase the convergence-order by three. The general expression for CO is 3s-1, where s is the number of steps of the multi-step iterative method. Computational efficiency is also addressed in comparison with other existing methods. The claimed convergence-rates proofs are established. The new contribution in this article relies essentially in the increment of CO by three for each added step, with a comparable computational cost in comparison with existing multi-steps iterative methods. Numerical assessments are made which justify the theoretical results: in particular, some systems of nonlinear equations associated with the numerical approximation of partial differential equations (PDEs) and ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are built up and solved. \&copy; 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {Based on functional analysis, we propose an algorithm for finite-norm solutions of higher-order linear Fuchsian-type ordinary differential equations (ODEs) P(x,d/dx)f(x)=0 with P(x,d/dx) :=(\&sum;m=0$<$/inf$>$\textsuperscript{M}p m$<$/inf$>$(x)(d/dx)\textsuperscript{m}) by using only the four arithmetical operations on integers. This algorithm is based on a band-diagonal matrix representation of the differential operator P(x,d/dx), though it is quite different from the usual Galerkin methods. This representation is made for the respective CONSs of the input Hilbert space and the output Hilbert space \textsuperscript{\&diam;} of P(x,d/dx). This band-diagonal matrix enables the construction of a recursive algorithm for solving the ODE. However, a solution of the simultaneous linear equations represented by this matrix does not necessarily correspond to the true solution of ODE. We show that when this solution is an l\textsuperscript{2}2 sequence, it corresponds to the true solution of ODE. We invent a method based on an integer-type algorithm for extracting only l\textsuperscript{2}2 components. Further, the concrete choice of Hilbert spaces and \textsuperscript{\&diam;} is also given for our algorithm when pm$<$/inf$>$ is a polynomial or a rational function with rational coefficients. We check how our algorithm works based on several numerical demonstrations related to special functions, where the results show that the accuracy of our method is extremely high (with several hundred or several thousand significant digits).

Numerous research efforts focused on the stability and accuracy of different integration algorithms for linear elastic structures. However, investigations of those properties applied to nonlinear structures are limited. Systematic Lyapunov stability and accuracy analyses of several direct integration algorithms for nonlinear structural dynamics are presented. These integration algorithms include the implicit methods of the Newmark family of integration algorithm and the TRBDF2 algorithm, and the explicit methods of operator-splitting (OS) algorithms. Two versions of the OS algorithms, using initial and tangent stiffness formulations, are investigated. The latter one is shown to possess similar stability properties to the implicit Newmark integration. Some arguments of stability regarding these direct integration algorithms from past studies are found to be groundless. An approach that enables performing the stability analysis numerically is proposed. It transforms the stability analysis to a problem of convex optimization. In addition, accuracy of the previously discussed five integration algorithms is investigated using a geometrically nonlinear test problem, in which acceptable amounts of period elongation and amplitude decay were evident.},

In addition to this, a regularised penalty force is devised to ensure exact energy conservation for frictionless contact analysis using the trapezoidal rule.

In the solution of wave propagation problems, a demonstrative dispersion analysis is given and problems are solved to illustrate the capabilities of the schemes for the solution of wave propagation problems as well as the numerical dissipation characteristics of the schemes. The nonlinear dynamic behavior of the Wen scheme is studied by considering commonly used nonlinear dynamic problems where the nonlinear performance of the scheme is exclusively compared with the Bathe and TTBDF schemes. The priority ranks of three presented composite schemes for different types of dynamic problems are obtained by theoretical and numerical analysis.},

  volume = {193},
  abstract = {Abstract The advantages of using the generalised-alpha scheme for first-order systems for computing the numerical solutions of second-order equations encountered in structural dynamics are presented. The governing equations are rewritten so that the second-order equations can be solved directly without having to convert them into state-space. The stability, accuracy, dissipation and dispersion characteristics of the scheme are discussed. It is proved through spectral analysis that the proposed scheme has improved dissipation properties when compared with the standard generalised-alpha scheme for second-order equations. It is also proved that the proposed scheme does not suffer from overshoot. Towards demonstrating the application to practical problems, proposed scheme is applied to the benchmark example of three degrees of freedom stiff-flexible spring-mass system, two-dimensional Howe truss model, and elastic pendulum problem discretised with non-linear truss finite elements.},

Also our method allows the thickness to be evaluated one point at a time, so computation can be focused on a localised region of the model.

Certain choices of the representation formula for the heat potential yield boundary integral equations of the first kind, namely the single layer and the hypersingular heat operator equations. Both of these operators, in particular, are covered by the class of parabolic pseudodifferential operators under consideration. Moreover, the spatial domain is allowed to have a general smooth boundary curve. As trial functions the tensor products of the smoothest spline functions of odd degree (space) and continuous piecewise linear splines (time) are used. Stability and convergence of the method is proved in some appropriate anisotropic Sobolev spaces. \&copy; 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

The NURBS based high order BEM method is used to calculate the velocity potential at each time step. An artificial damping layer is adopted as the far field radiation condition on the free surface to avoid the wave reflection from the outer boundary, and the present method is found to be numerically stable. The pressure on body can be obtained by solving a boundary integral equation of time derivative of velocity potential.

  abstract = {In recent years, volumetric (3D) cardiac ultrasound imaging has become more readily available in daily clinical practice due to the introduction of matrix array transducer technology. To date, quantitative analysis of these data sets typically requires a significant amount of user interaction. Recently, our teams introduced methods that could help in automating this process. On the one hand, an edge detection algorithm in combination with a deformable subdivision surface was presented for automatic segmentation of the LV cavity. A real-time, dynamic implementation of this segmentation approach in combination with a Kalman filter allows tracking the subendocardial boundary throughout the cardiac cycle. This method is referred to as RCTL. On the other hand, an automatic 3D motion estimation algorithm was presented in which subsequent image volumes are elastically registered using a B-spline transformation field. This method is called splineMIRIT. Both methods were applied to clinical data to extract relevant functional parameters on global left ventricular (LV) function (i.e. stroke volume (SV) and ejection fraction (EF)). Both methods show a good correlation with the reference method and might thus be used for fully automated estimation of global LV function. Given that RCTL is a fully integrated method (accounting for both segmentation and tracking) it seems to be the better approach towards extracting these parameters. However, whether this remains true when assessing parameters for regional LV function remains to be investigated. \&copy;2009 IEEE.},

  abstract = {The knowledge of the electron density is the key point in correcting ionospheric delays of electromagnetic measurements and in studying the ionosphere. During the last decade GNSS, in particular GPS, has become a promising tool for monitoring the total electron content (TEC), i.e., the integral of the electron density along the ray-path between the transmitting satellite and the receiver. Hence, geometry-free GNSS measurements provide informations on the electron density, which is basically a four-dimensional function depending on spatial position and time. In addition, these GNSS measurements can be combined with other available data including nadir, over-ocean TEC observations from dual-frequency radar altimetry (T/P, JASON, ENVISAT), and TECs from GPS-LEO occultation systems (e.g., FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC, CHAMP) with heterogeneous sampling and accuracy. In this paper, we present different multi-dimensional approaches for modeling spatio-temporal variations of the ionospheric electron density. To be more specific, we split the target function into a reference part, computed from the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI), and an unknown correction term. Due to the localizing feature of B-spline functions we apply tensor-product spline expansions to model the correction term in a certain multi-dimensional region either completely or partly. Furthermore, the multi-resolution representation derived from wavelet analysis allows monitoring the ionosphere at different resolutions levels. For demonstration we apply three approaches to electron density data over South America. \&copy; 2007 COSPAR.},

  abstract = {A digital/analog hybrid system is presented which implements the cardinal polynomial spline interpolation of arbitrary degree. Based on the fact that the (m - 1)st derivative of a spline of degree m - 1 is a staircase function, this system generates a cardinal spline of degree m - 1 by m - 1 cascaded integrators with a staircase function input. A given sequence of sampled values are transformed by a digital filter into coefficients for the B-spline representation of the spline interpolating the sampled values. The values of its (m - 1)st derivative with respect to time are computed by the recurrence formula interpreting differentiation of the spline as difference of the coefficients. Then a digital-to-analog converter generates a staircase function representing the (m - 1)st derivative, which is integrated by a cascade of m - 1 analog integrators to make the expected spline. In order to cope with the offset errors involved in the integrators, a dynamical sampled-data control is attached. An analog-to-digital converter is employed to sample the output of the cascaded integrators. Target state of the cascaded integrators at each sampling instance is computed from the coefficients for the B-spline representation. The state error between the target and the estimated is compensated by feeding back a weighted sum of the state error to the staircase input.},

An important aspect of studying is to understand how the roles played by these molecules and signaling pathways are integrated. And a widely used approach is to characterize phenotype-specific morphological dynamics among various types of cells. Traditionally, amoeboid motility has been characterized by a number of different parameters [5]. Some, such as velocity, directional persistence, and chemotactic index, are determined by the position of the cell's centroid as it migrates in response to external chemical cues, a process known as chemotaxis. Characterizations which address cellular morphology are based on cell shape parameters such as perimeter, area, roundness, and body orientation. Though these parameters can be used to identify some differences between strains of chemotactic cells, they primarily provide global information about chemotaxis and chemoattractant-induced cell shape changes, hence are insufficient to distinguish cell strains based on local morphological information, such as pseudopodial protrusions, that typify amoeboid motility. When the activities of pseudopodia are described in some studies, the protrusions have been identified and outlined manually [6], [7]. In addition to being highly time consuming, these manual methods have the drawback that they are based on subjective judgements. Thus, an efficient and systematic approach is necessary for cell shape characterization. Here, we develop a series of automated methods to characterize amoeboid locomotion based on the skeleton of a planar shape [8]. Skeletonization, also known as the medial axis transform, is a technique in morphological image processing used to reduce a binary shape into a series of connected lines - the skeleton - which roughly maintain the form of the shape. Though it has long been used to analyze static shapes in cell biology [9]-[12], skeletonization has not been used to track dynamic shape information during amoeboid motility. To achieve this, three imaging techniques were used to acquire movies of motile Dictyostelium cells during chemotaxis: fluorescent, phase-contrast, and differential interference contrast (DIC). Accordingly, three different image segmentation approaches were designed to generate binary images from these movies, where the white regions represented cell area and the black ones were background. Next, to remove high-frequency spatial fluctuations resulted from image noise, quadratic B-spline curves were fitted to cell boundaries based on the shape-space model and recursive least-square estimation [13]. Skeletonization was then used to extract the skeleton of each cell shape in the movies. Because the original skeletons were sensitive to small boundary variations, branch pruning was used following to eliminate the spurious ones based on the length of a branch and the local curvature of the corresponding boundary curve. Finally, these pruned skeletons were combined with the shape difference, which was defined as either "positive flow" or "negative flow" of a cell during motility, to locate pseudopodia protrusions and retractions (Fig. 1) and compute their angles and lengths. Our methods are capable of capturing the stochastic features of pseudopodial protrusions and retractions for various phenotypes. For example, we can quantify a cell's protrusion efficiency when moving toward the chemoattractant by looking at the angle distribution of protrusions along the membrane [14], [15]. This has been shown to provide more information compared to chemotactic index, a widely used quantity to characterize chemotaxis efficiency. Moreover, our methods are able to describe the temporal dynamics of individual pseudopodia by obtaining the time series of protrusion and retraction angles, and modeling it using a second-order autoregressive process [16]. Analysis based on these dynamics can provide various quantities to characterize pseudopodial activities among different phenotypes, such as lifetimes, splitting rates, and state persistences. Furthermore, our results can be coupled with the measurements of different cellular component distributions along the cell body, thus facilitate the understanding of the relation between cellular polarization and motility. \&copy; 2009 IEEE.},

The methodology is based on impulse response techniques. To this end, the fundamental solutions associated with the Boundary Integral Equation are derived for concentrated sources of higher order B-spline time modulation. High order spatial discretization is adopted. The solution is obtained in two major steps. First the B-spline Impulse Response Functions (BIRF) for a system of a specific geometry are calculated. BIRF functions are independent of the actual external excitation and need to be calculated only once for a given geometry. The second step calculates the response of the system to arbitrary excitations through a mere superposition of the BIRF functions. This paper discusses the development of the proposed BEM methodology and its validation. The method is shown to be stable regardless of the selection of the analysis time step, as opposed to the retarded potential techniques reported in the literature.

  issn = {13618415},
  abstract = {This paper presents a new registration algorithm, called Temporal Diffeomorphic Free Form Deformation (TDFFD), and its application to motion and strain quantification from a sequence of 3D ultrasound (US) images. The originality of our approach resides in enforcing time consistency by representing the 4D velocity field as the sum of continuous spatiotemporal B-Spline kernels. The spatiotemporal displacement field is then recovered through forward Eulerian integration of the non-stationary velocity field. The strain tensor is computed locally using the spatial derivatives of the reconstructed displacement field. The energy functional considered in this paper weighs two terms: the image similarity and a regularization term. The image similarity metric is the sum of squared differences between the intensities of each frame and a reference one. Any frame in the sequence can be chosen as reference. The regularization term is based on the incompressibility of myocardial tissue. TDFFD was compared to pairwise 3D FFD and 3D+t FFD, both on displacement and velocity fields, on a set of synthetic 3D US images with different noise levels. TDFFD showed increased robustness to noise compared to these two state-of-the-art algorithms. TDFFD also proved to be more resistant to a reduced temporal resolution when decimating this synthetic sequence. Finally, this synthetic dataset was used to determine optimal settings of the TDFFD algorithm. Subsequently, TDFFD was applied to a database of cardiac 3D US images of the left ventricle acquired from 9 healthy volunteers and 13 patients treated by Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT). On healthy cases, uniform strain patterns were observed over all myocardial segments, as physiologically expected. On all CRT patients, the improvement in synchrony of regional longitudinal strain correlated with CRT clinical outcome as quantified by the reduction of end-systolic left ventricular volume at follow-up (6 and 12. months), showing the potential of the proposed algorithm for the assessment of CRT. \&copy; 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

  title = {Haar Wavelets {{With}} Applications},
  abstract = {ABSTRACT This textbook presents a comprehensive overview of different applications of the Haar wavelet method. As known, the simplest wavelets are the Haar wavelets which are orthogonal, piecewise constant functions. The Haar wavelet method has some preferences, such as mathematical simplicity, existence of fast algorithms, and high accuracy for a small number of grid points. Thus very often the Haar wavelet method is simpler and faster than other methods. This useful book is mainly written for students and researchers in applied mathematics, physics and engineering. The authors demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the Haar wavelet method by numerous examples. All computations are realized by Matlab programs. This textbook consists of 14 chapters. The first two chapters introduce the Haar wavelets. In Chapters 3-5, the Haar wavelet method is applied to the numerical solution of ordinary differential equations, integral equations, and integro-differential equations. In order to solve a linear differential equation of order n, the n-th derivative is approximated by a finite Haar wavelet expansion (with unknown wavelet coefficients). Then all derivatives of lower order are calculated by integration. Substituting these expansions into the differential equation by collocation, one obtains a linear system for the wavelet coefficients which is to solve. In the Chapters 6 and 7, some partial differential equations are solved by the Haar wavelet method. A Haar wavelet solution of fractional integral equations is described in Chapter 8. Then, in Chapter 9, Haar wavelets are applied in optimal control theory. In Chapters 10-14, Haar wavelets are used for problems in structural mechanics, such as buckling of elastic beams and vibrations of elastic beams.},

In this paper, implementation of two different wavelet basis functions has been comparatively considered for dynamic analysis of structures. For this aim, computational technique is developed by using free scale of simple Haar wavelet, initially. Later, complex and continuous Chebyshev wavelet basis functions are presented to improve the time history analysis of structures. Free-scaled Chebyshev coefficient matrix and operation of integration are derived to directly approximate displacements of the corresponding system. In addition, stability of responses has been investigated for the proposed algorithm of discrete Haar wavelet compared against continuous Chebyshev wavelet. To demonstrate the validity of the wavelet-based algorithms, aforesaid schemes have been extended to the linear and nonlinear structural dynamics. The effectiveness of free-scaled Chebyshev wavelet has been compared with simple Haar wavelet and two common integration methods. It is deduced that either indirect method proposed for discrete Haar wavelet or direct approach for continuous Chebyshev wavelet is unconditionally stable. Finally, it is concluded that numerical solution is highly benefited by the least computation time involved and high accuracy of response, particularly using low scale of complex Chebyshev wavelet.},

  title = {A Wavelet-Based Approach for Vibration Analysis of Framed Structures},
  abstract = {In this paper, an explicit time integration scheme is proposed for structural vibration analysis by using wavelet functions. Initially, the differential equation of vibration governing SDOF (single-degree of freedom) systems has been solved by wavelet operators, and later the proposed approach has been generalized for MDOF (multi-degrees of freedom) systems. For this purpose, two different types of wavelet functions have been exemplified including, complex Chebyshev wavelet functions and simple Haar wavelet functions. In the proposed approach, a straightforward formulation has been derived from the numerical approximation of response through the wavelet definition. Emphasizing on frequency-domain approximation, a simple step-by-step algorithm has been implemented and improved to calculate the response of MDOF systems. Moreover, stability and accuracy of results have been evaluated. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated using three examples compared with some of the existing numerical integration schemes such as family of Newmark-尾, Wilson-胃 and central difference method. In all the procedures, computation time involved has also been considered. Finally, it is concluded that the vibration analysis of structures is improved by lesser computation time and high accuracy of proposed approach, particularly, in large-scaled systems.},

Starting from 'offering good solution to differential equations' to capturing the nonlinearity in the data distribution, wavelets are used as appropriate tools that provide good mathematical model for scientific phenomena, which are usually modeled through linear or nonlinear differential equations. Review shows that the Haar wavelet method (HWM) is efficient and powerful in solving wide class of linear and nonlinear differential equations. The discrete wavelet transform has gained the reputation of being a very effective signal analysis tool for many practical applications. This review intends to provide the great utility of Haar wavelets to science and engineering problems which owes its origin to 1910.

By improving the stability conditions, the larger time steps can be utilized. In this study, two parameters are introduced in the displacement and velocity extrapolations of IHOA. In order to find the optimum values of the proposed parameters, the dissipation and the dispersion are investigated. Three conditionally stable versions of the second-, third-, and forth-order algorithms are found. It is shown that these formulations have larger stability domains than the previous ones.

In order to have an appropriate estimation of stability domain, some suitable Lyapunov functions are calculated by satisfying the modified Zubov's partial differential equation in a finite area around the asymptotically stable equilibrium point. To achieve this, the techniques of Collocation, Galerkin, Least squares, Moments and Sub-domain are applied.

Several of these techniques have been reviewed in reference [1]. The method of finite spheres (MFS) [1] is a truly mesh free method in which the computational domain is discretized using spheres.

Two features render the proposed approach especially attractive from a computational perspective over conventional fourth order methods. First, the improved (fourth order) accuracy is attained merely by two additional residual evaluations, with no changes in the implementation of the underlying second order method. In particular, no additional storage or extra computations of high order gradients are required. Second, for Hamiltonian systems, the stability properties and possible conservation properties of the underlying second order method, such as energy, momentum and symplectic character, are preserved. The new technique is applied to a number of standard algorithms for elastodynamics, structural and rigid body dynamics. In particular, when applied to the recently proposed (second order accurate) energy-momentum method, this approach results in a fourth order accurate energy, linear and angular momentum conserving algorithm for general Hamiltonian systems.},

The standard finite element shape functions are used with interpolation cover functions over patches of elements to increase the convergence of the finite element scheme. The cover functions not only capture higher gradients of a field variable but also smooth out inter-element stress jumps. Since the order of the interpolations in the covers can vary, the method provides flexibility to use different covers for different patches and increases the solution accuracy without any local mesh refinement. As pointed out, the procedure can be derived from various general theoretical approaches and the basic theory has been presented earlier. We evaluate the effectiveness of the method, and illustrate the power of the scheme through the solution of various problems. The method also has potential for the development of error measures.

  abstract = {SUMMARYA new method is developed here for the real-time integration of the equations of solid dynamics based on the use of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)\textendash{}proper generalized decomposition (PGD) approaches and direct time integration. The method is based upon the formulation of solid dynamics equations as a parametric problem, depending on their initial conditions. A sort of black-box integrator that takes the resulting displacement field of the current time step as input and (via POD) provides the result for the subsequent time step at feedback rates on the order of 1 kHz is obtained. To avoid the so-called curse of dimensionality produced by the large amount of parameters in the formulation (one per degree of freedom of the full model), a combined POD\textendash{}PGD strategy is implemented. Examples that show the promising results of this technique are included. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Simulation of dynamic adhesive peeling problems at small scales has attracted little attention so far. These problems are characterized by a highly nonlinear response. Accurate and stable time integration schemes are required for simulation of dynamic peeling problems. In the present work, a composite time integration scheme is proposed for the simulation of dynamic adhesive peeling problems. It is shown through numerical examples that the proposed scheme remains stable and also has some gain in accuracy. The performance of the scheme is compared with two collocation-based schemes, i.e., Newmark scheme and Bathe composite scheme. It is shown that the proposed scheme and Bathe composite scheme perform equally. However, the proposed scheme adds very little to the computational cost of Newmark scheme. Through a numerical simulation of the peeling of a gecko spatula from a rigid substrate it is shown that the proposed scheme and the Bathe composite scheme are able to simulate the complete peeling process for given time step whereas the Newmark scheme diverges. It is also shown that the maximum pull-off force is within the range reported in the literature.},

This method belongs to the category of the multi time step integrations. Here, current displacement and velocity are assumed to be functions of the velocities and accelerations of several previous time steps, respectively. This definition causes that only one set of weighted factors appears in the proposed method which lead to the simple approach and reduce the computational efforts. To achieve this purpose, the Taylor series expansion and the Routh-Hurwitz criterion are utilized to verify the accuracy and stability of the proposed integration, respectively. Moreover, some dynamic systems such as the nonlinear vibration, the portal frame and the elastic pendulum will be analyzed to clarify the ability and the efficiency of the proposed time integration.

Methods that are unconditionally stable in linear analysis are sometimes observed to have convergence problems as in the case of solutions obtained with a trapezoidal method. On the other hand, a composite time integration method employing a trapezoidal rule and a three-point backward rule sequentially in two half steps can be used to obtain accurate results and enhance the stability of the system by means of a numerical damping introduced in the formulation. To have a better understanding of the differences in the numerical implementation of the algorithms of these two methods, a mathematical analysis of dynamic equilibrium equations is performed.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Thesis (S.B.)\textendash{}Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, 2007. Includes bibliographical references (p. 43). Direct integration schemes are important tools used in the dynamic analysis of many structures. It is critical that the solutions obtained from these schemes produce accurate results. Currently, one of the most widely used direct integration schemes is the trapezoidal rule. It is favored because it is a method that requires single steps and its results are second-order accurate. However, in cases where there are large deformations and longer integration times, the trapezoidal rule fails. A new composite method scheme shows promise in maintaining stability where the trapezoidal rule fails. It is a two step method that makes use of the trapezoidal rule and the three-point Euler backward method. The purpose of this study is to compare the trapezoidal rule and the new composite method using two nonlinear problems in order to determine if the composite method generates more accurate results than the trapezoidal rule. by Jennifer D.

Constraints on manipulators' kinematics were transferred to constraints on control points of B-splines, and genetic algorithm was exploited to globally minimize the integral of squared jerk and seek the according optimal time nodes, then smoothness-optimal trajectories were generated, and problems lied in the existing methods including taking no attention to jerk accumulation and constraints on kinematics or traveling time were solved.

For sheetmetal parts, when removed from dies after forming, are subject to springback due the resultant in-plane forces and moments throughout the sheet at the end of the forming processing. Therefore, springback should be compensated for integrating reverse engineering into the system of forming sheet metal with a complex surface. However, CAD modelling from measured points data is a roadblock to the automation of the duplication procedure. The difficulties here arise from surfaces fitting to measured points, which is well-known to be time-consuming. To avoid the roadblock, based on the convex hull property of B-spline, a new strategy for direct generation of die shapes from digitized points with springback compensation is presented in this paper.

A surface energy based formulation has been developed to incorporate the surface tension effects. The developed methodology leads to an updated Lagrangian scheme with a Galerkin in space and Least square in time formulation. The NURBS representation used for the spatial discretization enables the method to handle problems involving complex droplet geometries. The ability of the NURBS representation to provide both global and local control, along with the least square method used in this methodology, enables us to develop an unconditionally stable time integration scheme which can be optimized to achieve desired accuracy and numerical dissipation efficiently. A sample problem of droplet shape evolution has been solved to demonstrate the path prediction capability of the proposed methodology.

Major challenges in these missions are posed by uncertainties in atmospheric properties like density and winds.

The guidance algorithm uses B-spline parametrization of states to generate dynamically feasible optimal trajectories which steer the vehicle from entry interface conditions to a Final Approach Corridor, while simultaneously satisfying terminal conditions. Guidance trajectory acts as a reference trajectory for nonlinear adaptive controller which further generates the commanded moments based on reference input. Reaction control jet selection is accomplished using discrete control allocation. Discrete control allocation method can also handle various types of control failures. Performance is evaluated with a Mars Ellipsled vehicle non real-time simulation for a complete Mars entry trajectory tracking scenario. Simulation results presented in the paper demonstrate that the guidance algorithm generates the optimal trajectory under various terminal constraints while the fault tolerant control algorithm satisfactorily track this optimal trajectory in the presence of plant and environment uncertainties, in addition to control failures.

Certain choices of the representation formula for the heat potential yield boundary integral equations of the first kind, namely the single layer and the hypersingular heat operator equations. Both of these operators, in particular, are covered by the class of parabolic pseudodifferential operators under consideration. Moreover, the spatial domain is allowed to have a general smooth boundary curve. As trial functions the tensor products of the smoothest spline functions of odd degree (space) and continuous piecewise linear splines (time) are used. Stability and convergence of the method is proved in some appropriate anisotropic Sobolev spaces. \&copy; 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The knowledge of the electron density is the key point in correcting ionospheric delays of electromagnetic measurements and in studying the ionosphere. During the last decade GNSS, in particular GPS, has become a promising tool for monitoring the total electron content (TEC), i.e., the integral of the electron density along the ray-path between the transmitting satellite and the receiver. Hence, geometry-free GNSS measurements provide informations on the electron density, which is basically a four-dimensional function depending on spatial position and time. In addition, these GNSS measurements can be combined with other available data including nadir, over-ocean TEC observations from dual-frequency radar altimetry (T/P, JASON, ENVISAT), and TECs from GPS-LEO occultation systems (e.g., FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC, CHAMP) with heterogeneous sampling and accuracy. In this paper, we present different multi-dimensional approaches for modeling spatio-temporal variations of the ionospheric electron density. To be more specific, we split the target function into a reference part, computed from the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI), and an unknown correction term. Due to the localizing feature of B-spline functions we apply tensor-product spline expansions to model the correction term in a certain multi-dimensional region either completely or partly. Furthermore, the multi-resolution representation derived from wavelet analysis allows monitoring the ionosphere at different resolutions levels. For demonstration we apply three approaches to electron density data over South America. \&copy; 2007 COSPAR.},

  abstract = {To predict the motions and wave loads for ships and floating structures under extreme sea-state, a fully nonlinear time-domain computation program base on the Mixed Eulerian-Lagrangian method with high-order boundary element approach is developed and the validity of computational system is analyzed. The standard Runge-Kutta method and the fourth order Adams-Bashforth-Moulton method are used for the time step method. The NURBS based high order BEM method is used to calculate the velocity potential at each time step. An artificial damping layer is adopted as the far field radiation condition on the free surface to avoid the wave reflection from the outer boundary, and the present method is found to be numerically stable. The pressure on body can be obtained by solving a boundary integral equation of time derivative of velocity potential.

By making use of surface normal information the task of finding maximal spheres can be reduced to a simple minimisation problem, avoiding the calculation of Delaunay tetrahedra or Voronoi diagrams. Also our method allows the thickness to be evaluated one point at a time, so computation can be focused on a localised region of the model.

  abstract = {A digital/analog hybrid system is presented which implements the cardinal polynomial spline interpolation of arbitrary degree. Based on the fact that the (m - 1)st derivative of a spline of degree m - 1 is a staircase function, this system generates a cardinal spline of degree m - 1 by m - 1 cascaded integrators with a staircase function input. A given sequence of sampled values are transformed by a digital filter into coefficients for the B-spline representation of the spline interpolating the sampled values. The values of its (m - 1)st derivative with respect to time are computed by the recurrence formula interpreting differentiation of the spline as difference of the coefficients. Then a digital-to-analog converter generates a staircase function representing the (m - 1)st derivative, which is integrated by a cascade of m - 1 analog integrators to make the expected spline. In order to cope with the offset errors involved in the integrators, a dynamical sampled-data control is attached. An analog-to-digital converter is employed to sample the output of the cascaded integrators. Target state of the cascaded integrators at each sampling instance is computed from the coefficients for the B-spline representation. The state error between the target and the estimated is compensated by feeding back a weighted sum of the state error to the staircase input.},

  abstract = {In recent years, volumetric (3D) cardiac ultrasound imaging has become more readily available in daily clinical practice due to the introduction of matrix array transducer technology. To date, quantitative analysis of these data sets typically requires a significant amount of user interaction. Recently, our teams introduced methods that could help in automating this process. On the one hand, an edge detection algorithm in combination with a deformable subdivision surface was presented for automatic segmentation of the LV cavity. A real-time, dynamic implementation of this segmentation approach in combination with a Kalman filter allows tracking the subendocardial boundary throughout the cardiac cycle. This method is referred to as RCTL. On the other hand, an automatic 3D motion estimation algorithm was presented in which subsequent image volumes are elastically registered using a B-spline transformation field. This method is called splineMIRIT. Both methods were applied to clinical data to extract relevant functional parameters on global left ventricular (LV) function (i.e. stroke volume (SV) and ejection fraction (EF)). Both methods show a good correlation with the reference method and might thus be used for fully automated estimation of global LV function. Given that RCTL is a fully integrated method (accounting for both segmentation and tracking) it seems to be the better approach towards extracting these parameters. However, whether this remains true when assessing parameters for regional LV function remains to be investigated. \&copy;2009 IEEE.},

  title = {Automated Characterization of Amoeboid Motility},
  copyright = {Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.},
  abstract = {Cells use a variety of methods to migrate. One of these, referred to as amoeboid motion, involves alternating cycles of morphological expansion and retraction [1]. Employed by numerous mammalian cell lines including neutrophils and lymphocytes [2], [3], it is also seen in the metastatic migration of some tumor cells [4]. Amoeboid motility is best understood in the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum. It is a complex cellular process driven by highly-organized cytoskeletal dynamics containing numerous molecular species and regulated by an intricate signaling network. An important aspect of studying is to understand how the roles played by these molecules and signaling pathways are integrated. And a widely used approach is to characterize phenotype-specific morphological dynamics among various types of cells. Traditionally, amoeboid motility has been characterized by a number of different parameters [5]. Some, such as velocity, directional persistence, and chemotactic index, are determined by the position of the cell's centroid as it migrates in response to external chemical cues, a process known as chemotaxis. Characterizations which address cellular morphology are based on cell shape parameters such as perimeter, area, roundness, and body orientation. Though these parameters can be used to identify some differences between strains of chemotactic cells, they primarily provide global information about chemotaxis and chemoattractant-induced cell shape changes, hence are insufficient to distinguish cell strains based on local morphological information, such as pseudopodial protrusions, that typify amoeboid motility. When the activities of pseudopodia are described in some studies, the protrusions have been identified and outlined manually [6], [7]. In addition to being highly time consuming, these manual methods have the drawback that they are based on subjective judgements. Thus, an efficient and systematic approach is necessary for cell shape characterization. Here, we develop a series of automated methods to characterize amoeboid locomotion based on the skeleton of a planar shape [8]. Skeletonization, also known as the medial axis transform, is a technique in morphological image processing used to reduce a binary shape into a series of connected lines - the skeleton - which roughly maintain the form of the shape. Though it has long been used to analyze static shapes in cell biology [9]-[12], skeletonization has not been used to track dynamic shape information during amoeboid motility. To achieve this, three imaging techniques were used to acquire movies of motile Dictyostelium cells during chemotaxis: fluorescent, phase-contrast, and differential interference contrast (DIC). Accordingly, three different image segmentation approaches were designed to generate binary images from these movies, where the white regions represented cell area and the black ones were background. Next, to remove high-frequency spatial fluctuations resulted from image noise, quadratic B-spline curves were fitted to cell boundaries based on the shape-space model and recursive least-square estimation [13]. Skeletonization was then used to extract the skeleton of each cell shape in the movies. Because the original skeletons were sensitive to small boundary variations, branch pruning was used following to eliminate the spurious ones based on the length of a branch and the local curvature of the corresponding boundary curve. Finally, these pruned skeletons were combined with the shape difference, which was defined as either "positive flow" or "negative flow" of a cell during motility, to locate pseudopodia protrusions and retractions (Fig. 1) and compute their angles and lengths. Our methods are capable of capturing the stochastic features of pseudopodial protrusions and retractions for various phenotypes. For example, we can quantify a cell's protrusion efficiency when moving toward the chemoattractant by looking at the angle distribution of protrusions along the membrane [14], [15]. This has been shown to provide more information compared to chemotactic index, a widely used quantity to characterize chemotaxis efficiency. Moreover, our methods are able to describe the temporal dynamics of individual pseudopodia by obtaining the time series of protrusion and retraction angles, and modeling it using a second-order autoregressive process [16]. Analysis based on these dynamics can provide various quantities to characterize pseudopodial activities among different phenotypes, such as lifetimes, splitting rates, and state persistences. Furthermore, our results can be coupled with the measurements of different cellular component distributions along the cell body, thus facilitate the understanding of the relation between cellular polarization and motility. \&copy; 2009 IEEE.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new Boundary Element Method (BEM) in the direct time domain for the solution of the wave propagation problem in 3D homogenous inviscid acoustic media. The methodology is based on impulse response techniques. To this end, the fundamental solutions associated with the Boundary Integral Equation are derived for concentrated sources of higher order B-spline time modulation. High order spatial discretization is adopted. The solution is obtained in two major steps. First the B-spline Impulse Response Functions (BIRF) for a system of a specific geometry are calculated. BIRF functions are independent of the actual external excitation and need to be calculated only once for a given geometry. The second step calculates the response of the system to arbitrary excitations through a mere superposition of the BIRF functions. This paper discusses the development of the proposed BEM methodology and its validation. The method is shown to be stable regardless of the selection of the analysis time step, as opposed to the retarded potential techniques reported in the literature. The high level of accuracy and the efficiency of the method are demonstrated. \&copy; 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  issn = {13618415},
  abstract = {This paper presents a new registration algorithm, called Temporal Diffeomorphic Free Form Deformation (TDFFD), and its application to motion and strain quantification from a sequence of 3D ultrasound (US) images. The originality of our approach resides in enforcing time consistency by representing the 4D velocity field as the sum of continuous spatiotemporal B-Spline kernels. The spatiotemporal displacement field is then recovered through forward Eulerian integration of the non-stationary velocity field. The strain tensor is computed locally using the spatial derivatives of the reconstructed displacement field. The energy functional considered in this paper weighs two terms: the image similarity and a regularization term. The image similarity metric is the sum of squared differences between the intensities of each frame and a reference one. Any frame in the sequence can be chosen as reference. The regularization term is based on the incompressibility of myocardial tissue. TDFFD was compared to pairwise 3D FFD and 3D+t FFD, both on displacement and velocity fields, on a set of synthetic 3D US images with different noise levels. TDFFD showed increased robustness to noise compared to these two state-of-the-art algorithms. TDFFD also proved to be more resistant to a reduced temporal resolution when decimating this synthetic sequence. Finally, this synthetic dataset was used to determine optimal settings of the TDFFD algorithm. Subsequently, TDFFD was applied to a database of cardiac 3D US images of the left ventricle acquired from 9 healthy volunteers and 13 patients treated by Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT). On healthy cases, uniform strain patterns were observed over all myocardial segments, as physiologically expected. On all CRT patients, the improvement in synchrony of regional longitudinal strain correlated with CRT clinical outcome as quantified by the reduction of end-systolic left ventricular volume at follow-up (6 and 12. months), showing the potential of the proposed algorithm for the assessment of CRT. \&copy; 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Direct-drive linear reciprocating compressors offer numerous advantages over conventional counterparts which are usually driven by a rotary induction motor via a crank shaft. However, to ensure efficient and reliable operation under all conditions, it is essential that motor current of a linear compressor follows a sinusoidal current command with a frequency which matches the system resonant frequency. The design of a high-performance current controller for linear compressor drive presents a challenge since the system is highly nonlinear, and an effective solution must be low cost. In this paper, a learning feed-forward current controller for the linear compressors is proposed. It comprises a conventional feedback proportional-integral controller and a feed-forward B-spline neural network (BSNN). The feed-forward BSNN is trained online and in real time in order to minimize the current tracking error. Extensive simulation and experiment results with a prototype linear compressor show that the proposed current controller exhibits high steady state and transient performance. \&copy; 2009 IEEE.},

Here, a numerical study is presented that describes the photomechanical structural dynamic behavior of an LCN in a fluid medium; however, the methodology is also applicable to fluid-structure interactions of a broader range of adaptive structures. Here, we simulate the oscillation of photomechanical cantilevers excited by light while simultaneously modeling the effect of the surrounding fluid at different ambient pressures. The photoactuated LCN is modeled as an elastic thin cantilever plate, and gradients in photostrain from the external light are computed from the assumptions of light absorption and photoisomerization through the film thickness. Numerical approximations of the equations governing the plate are based on cubic B-spline shape functions and a second order implicit Newmark central scheme for time integration. For the fluid, three dimensional unsteady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved using the arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) method, which employs a structured body-fitted curvilinear coordinate system where the solid-fluid interface is a mesh line of the system, and the complicated interface boundary conditions are accommodated in a conventional finite-volume formulation. Numerical examples are given which provide new insight into material behavior in a fluid medium as a function of ambient pressure. \&copy; 2012.},

  abstract = {Path generations are a necessary integral part of any automated machining approach using 3-axis robots. Given an input path in form of a piecewise linear curve, we automatically generate an optimized path that lies within a given error bound or tolerance band of the input path. The optimization is targeted at minimizing the processing time of the machining process. As sharp turns require the robot to slow down, we want to minimize the local curvature at each point of the curve. Our approach is an efficient offline algorithm that consists of several processing steps. Ina preprocessing step, we analyze the input path and split it into small groups. The groups are categorized and can be handled independently and locally. We apply a local sleeve concept for complicated groups and a local Bezierapproximation for simple groups. In a post processing step the groups are combined to form a G\textsuperscript{2}-continuous path. Our approach achieves high-quality results that are comparable to the sleeves approach while being significantly more efficient (speed-up of one order of magnitude) when applied to real-world problems. \&copy; 2011 IEEE.},

  abstract = {An efficient gradient-based algorithm for aerodynamic shape optimization is presented. The algorithm consists of several components, including a novel integrated geometry parameterization and mesh movement, a parallel Newton-Krylov flow solver, and an adjoint-based gradient evaluation. To integrate geometry parameterization and mesh movement, generalized B-spline volumes are used to parameterize both the surface and volume mesh. The volume mesh of B-spline control points mimics a coarse mesh; a linear elasticity mesh-movement algorithm is applied directly to this coarse mesh and the fine mesh is regenerated algebraically. Using this approach, mesh-movement time is reduced by two to three orders of magnitude relative to a node-based movement. The mesh-adjoint system also becomes smaller and is thus amenable to complex-step derivative approximations. When solving the flow-adjoint equations using restarted Krylov-subspace methods, a nested-subspace strategy is shown to be more robust than truncating the entire subspace. Optimization is accomplished using a sequential-quadratic-programming algorithm. The effectiveness of the complete algorithm is demonstrated using a lift-constrained induced-drag minimization that involves large changes in geometry. Copyright \&copy; 2009 by J. E. Hicken and D.W.

The algorithm search for a trade-off between the need for a short execution time and the requirement of a sufficiently smooth trajectory, which is the well known necessary condition to limit the vibration during fast movements. The trade-off is achieved by adjusting the weight of two suitable functions, able to consider both the execution time and the squared-jerk integral along the whole trajectory. The main feature of this algorithm is its ability to smooth the trajectory's profile by adjusting the intervals between two consecutive via-points so that the overall time is minimally delayed. The practical importance of this technique lies in the fact that it can be implemented in any industrialmanipulator without a hardware upgrade. The algorithm does not need for a dynamic model of the robot: only the mechanical constraints on the position, velocity and acceleration ranges have to be set a priori. The experimental proof is provided in this paper by comparing the results of the proposed algorithm with those obtained by adopting some classical algorithms. \&copy; Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.},

The techniques include adaptive shading of grid data to enhance linear features, a segment-tracing algorithm to extract line segments from the shaded grid data, grouping of the segments by concatenating short segments, and connecting them by proximity and co-linearity criteria to form a lineament that represents significant tectonic structure. B-spline smoothing was adopted for lineament representation. Finally, a technique for assessing the orientations and styles of faulting (normal, reverse, and strike-slip types) was developed for use in characterizing the extrapolated fracture planes. The applicability of the developed techniques was examined using 30. arc-second topography/bathymetry grids, 1-min gravity anomaly grids, and 2-min total field magnetic intensity grids covering Egypt and its surroundings. Lineaments derived from data types so diverse in composition and from various depths corresponded well with the referenced tectonic features over much of the region. Prominent trends and faulting styles of lineaments provided important clues as to the timing of their development as well as strong support for a structural inheritance model. Results demonstrated the effectiveness of the developed techniques combined with integration of remotely-sensed data in detecting regional fracture systems accurately and in characterizing geodynamics over a long timeframe. \&copy; 2011 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

The proposed closed-form TDGF's characterize scalar and vector potentials due to infinitesimal horizontal electric dipoles with Dirac delta temporal signature. The closed-form TDGFs are numerically validated by comparison with data derived using the Cagniard-de Hoop method. They also are used in a high-order accurate, marching-on-in-time-based time-domain integral equation (TDIE) solver. This TDIE solver calls for the computation of convolutions of TDGFs with temporal basis functions. Here, these convolutions too are cast in closed-form, assuming that the temporal basis function is a quadratic B-Spline (QBS). Numerical examples that demonstrate the applicability of the proposed scheme to the problem of scattering from planar PEC structures residing in the interface of a half-space medium are presented. \&copy; 2012 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Context. The Gaia mission will produce a stereoscopic map of the Milky Way by collecting highly accurate positions, parallaxes and proper motions for about 1 billion stars. These astrometric parameters will be determined through the astrometric core solution of the Gaia mission which will employ about 10 \textsuperscript{8} primary sources (a subset of the observed sources with the best astrometric properties). The attitude of the spacecraft is reconstructed as part of the astrometric solution and provides the reference frame relative to which the astrometric measurements are obtained. This implies extreme demands on the accuracy of the attitude reconstruction. Aims. This paper presents an analysis of the capabilities and limitations of the Gaia attitude reconstruction, focusing on the effects on the astrometry of bright (V a\&circ;\&permil; 11) stars and the implications of employing cubic B-splines in the modelling of the attitude measurements. Methods. We simulate the attitude of the spacecraft using a realistic and very detailed model that considers not only physical effects but also technical aspects like the control system and thruster noise. We include the effect of shorter integration times for the bright stars on the effective attitude and we estimate the residual modelling noise in the reconstruction of the attitude. Results. We provide an analysis of the dependency of the residual modelling noise in the reconstructed attitude with respect to the following parameters: integration time, B-spline knot interval, micro-propulsion system noise, and number of observations per second. Conclusions. The final noise in the attitude reconstruction for Gaia is estimated to be \&asyum;20 \&mu;as, and the main source will be the micro-propulsion system. However its effect on the astrometric performance will be limited, adding up to 7 \&mu;as rms to the parallax uncertainties. This is larger than the 4 \&mu;as from previous estimations and would affect the performance for the brightest (V \&permil; 11) stars. \&copy; 2013 ESO.},

To overcome the shortcoming of modeling using the static B-spline basis function, dynamic basis functions are used to carry out the iterative modeling and fault tolerant control. By separating the whole control horizon into certain number of the time domain sub-intervals called batches, in each batch, the radial basis function (RBF) is fixed and the adaptive observer based fault diagnosis algorithm is used to estimate the size of the fault. Between two batches, the centers and widths of the RBF, the gain of the fault diagnosis observer and the parameters of the controller should all be tuned. In the next batch, the post-tuning RBF are used to approximate the output PDF and the post-tuning fault tolerant controller is used to act on the system, leading to integrated fault diagnosis and fault tolerant control. \&copy; 2013 TCCT, CAA.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present a method for coronary artery motion tracking in 4D cardiac CT angiogram data sets. The proposed method allows the construction of patient-specific 4D coronary motion model from pre-operative CTA which can be used for guiding totally endoscopic coronary artery bypass surgery (TECAB). The proposed approach consists of three steps: Firstly, the coronary arteries are extracted in the end-diastolic time frame using a minimal cost path approach. To achieve this, the start and end points of the coronaries are identified interactively and the minimal cost path between the start and end points is computed using A*graph search algorithm. Secondly, the cardiac motion is estimated throughout the cardiac cycle by using a non-rigid image registration technique based on a free-form B-spline transformation model and maximization of normalized mutual information. Finally, coronary arteries are tracked automatically through all other phases of the cardiac cycle. This is estimated by deforming the extracted coronaries at end-diastole to all other time frames according the motion field acquired in second step. The estimated coronary centerlines are then refined by template matching algorithm to improve the accuracy. We compare the proposed approach with two alternative approaches: The first approach is based on the minimal cost path extraction of the coronaries with start and end points manually identified in each time frame while the second approach is based on propagating the extracted coronaries from the end-diastolic time frame to other time frames using image-based non-rigid registration only. Our results show that the proposed approach performs more robustly than the non-rigid registration based method and that the resulting motion model is comparable to the motion model constructed from semi-automatic extractions of the coronaries in all time frames. \&copy; 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

  issn = {0022460X},
  abstract = {Minimizing the operating clearance between rotating bladed-disks and stationary surrounding casings is a primary concern in the design of modern turbomachines since it may advantageously affect their energy efficiency. This technical choice possibly leads to interactions between elastic structural components through direct unilateral contact and dry friction, events which are now accepted as normal operating conditions. Subsequent nonlinear dynamical behaviors of such systems are commonly investigated with simplified academic models mainly due to theoretical difficulties and numerical challenges involved in non-smooth large-scale realistic models. In this context, the present paper introduces an adaptation of a full three-dimensional contact strategy for the prediction of potentially damaging motions that would imply highly demanding computational efforts for the targeted aerospace application in an industrial context. It combines a smoothing procedure including bicubic B-spline patches together with a Lagrange multiplier based contact strategy within an explicit time-marching integration procedure preferred for its versatility. The proposed algorithm is first compared on a benchmark configuration against the more elaborated bi-potential formulation and the commercial software Ansys. The consistency of the provided results and the low energy fluctuations of the introduced approach underlines its reliable numerical properties. A case study featuring blade-tip/casing contact on industrial finite element models is then proposed: it incorporates component mode synthesis and the developed three-dimensional contact algorithm for investigating structural interactions occurring within a turbomachine compressor stage. Both time results and frequency-domain analysis emphasize the practical use of such a numerical tool: detection of severe operating conditions and critical rotational velocities, time-dependent maps of stresses acting within the structures, parameter studies and blade design tests. \&copy; 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {This article considers the following manufacturing/logistics problem: an autonomous vehicle (AV) is requested to serve a set of pickup and delivery (P/D) stations in the shop floor of a modern factory providing P/D tasks while moving safely (i.e., avoiding any collision with obstacles) in its environment. A two-sided time window associated with each P/D station brackets the service time to within a specified interval. A tour for AV is considered legal if it (a) is collision free, (b) passes through each P/D station exactly once, and (c) satisfies the service time restrictions imposed by the P/D stations. A legal tour always starts and ends at a depot. The problem is thereby dual NP-hard because it combines the characteristics of path planning and those of vehicle routing and scheduling problems. The objective is to determine the shortest possible legal tour for AV. A new method is introduced to solve the problem accomplished in two successive phases: first, AV's environment is mapped into a 2D B-spline surface embedded in 3D Euclidean space using a robust geometric model. Then, the generated surface is searched using a genetic algorithm for an optimum legal tour that satisfies the requirements of the vehicle's mission. The performance of the proposed method is investigated and discussed through characteristic simulated experiments. Copyright \&copy; 2012 Taylor \&amp; Francis Group, LLC.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of above-threshold ionization (ATI) of hydrogen interacting with a short and intense x-ray electromagnetic field. We consider the weakly relativistic regime where the speed of the photoelectron stays well below the velocity of the light c. We solve the time-dependent Schro\&die;dinger equation (TDSE) using a spectral approach with a basis of one-electron orbitals, calculated with L2-integrable B-spline functions for the radial coordinate and bipolar spherical harmonics Ylm$<$/inf$>$ for the angular part. Retardation effects are included up to O(1/c); they induce two extra terms leading to electric quadrupole and magnetic dipole transitions. These latter terms depend on the polarization and photon momentum directions, forcing the resolution of the TDSE in a three-dimensional space. Relativistic effects [of O(1/c2)] are fully neglected. Photoelectron energy and angular distributions are obtained for photon energies ranging from 200 eV to 3 keV. We study the lower energy region of the ATI spectrum and we analyze nondipole effects, through their (l,m) components, in particular, for the lower two peaks. Although these effects are small, we show that, increasing the photon energy, the photoelectron angular distributions begin to differ significantly from the ones obtained in dipole approximation. \&copy; 2012 American Physical Society.},

These applications demand the use of high performance controllers. Some desirable characteristics in motion controllers are coordinated multi-axis control, smooth movements, and advanced interpolation methods. An important manufacturing aspect involves the production of a workpiece in a free form or using the parametric surfaces in modern computer aided design/computer aided manufacturing systems. The use of parametric curves and surfaces has become standard due to their ability to represent objects having complex surfaces with less data. Another mandatory characteristic of motion controllers is the real-time operation. The contribution of the present work is the design and implementation of a hardware-software system for multi-axis motion control featuring non uniform rational B-splines interpolation. Advantages over other reported works are the hardware implementation which allows the application to real computer numerically controlled machines; also the parallel processing permits the incorporation of additional modules to form an integral system without dependence on external devices.

The transient responses of the system are obtained by the two proposed techniques. In the light of the comparison results, the Laguerre functions are shown to be the more accurate.

  abstract = {Even though isogeometric analysis has a clear advantage regarding the number of degrees of freedom needed to achieve a certain level of accuracy, the time needed for matrix assembly (by means of numerical integration of stiffness or mass matrix entries) constitutes a severe bottleneck in the process. In order to overcome this difficulty, we propose the new approach of Integration by Interpolation and Lookup (IIL). Firstly, applying spline interpolation to the common factors in the occurring integrals approximately transforms them into integrals of piecewise polynomial functions, whose integrands are expressed in tensor-product B-spline form. The common factors represent the influence of the geometry mapping (i.e.,the NURBS domain parameterization) and the contributions of possibly non-constant material coefficients. Secondly, these integrals are evaluated exactly using pre-computed look-up tables for integrals of tri-products of univariate B-splines and their derivatives. For the model case of elliptic problems, we perform a theoretical analysis to demonstrate that the IIL method maintains the overall approximation order of the Galerkin discretization, provided that the spline interpolation is sufficiently accurate. Moreover, we provide a comparison of the computational complexity of our method with that of a standard Gauss quadrature method. Finally, we present experimental results to illustrate the performance of the IIL method and to support our theoretical results. \&copy; 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Over recent years there has been a growing demand for materials that possess a wide variation of constitutive properties, which may not naturally occur within homogeneous materials. The evolution of composite materials has led to the development of a relatively new class, commonly referred to as functionally graded materials, which consist of two or more materials (often metals and ceramics) with properties varying continuously with respect to spatial coordinates. In this paper, the dynamic response of a functionally graded (FG) beam is analysed using the wavelet finite element method (WFEM). The scaling functions of the Daubechies wavelet and B-spline wavelet on the interval (BSWI) families are employed as interpolating functions for the construction of the wavelet-based FG beam elements; based on Euler Bernoulli beam theory. The FG beam, comprising of steel and alumina, is assumed to vary continuously in the transverse and axial directions according to the power law. The free vibrations behaviour of a FG beam with different material distributions is compared with other approaches from published data to validate and assess the performance of this formulation. A FG beam resting on a viscoelastic foundation is analysed when subjected to a moving point load. The dynamic responses are evaluated using the Newmark time integration method. The effects of the material distribution, velocity of the moving load and damping of the system are discussed based on the numerical examples presented. The results indicate that WFEMs achieve higher levels of accuracy with fewer elements implemented, in comparison to the classical finite element method, in the analysis of the FG beam. Furthermore, the BSWI wavelet-based approach performs better than the Daubechies-based WFEM. \&copy; 2015 Taylor \& Francis.},

  copyright = {Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.},
  abstract = {This paper discusses fundamental issues related to the integration of computer aided design and analysis (I-CAD-A) by introducing a new class of ideal compliant joints that account for the distributed inertia and elasticity. The absolute nodal coordinate formulation (ANCF) degrees of freedom are used in order to capture modes of deformation that cannot be captured using existing formulations. The ideal compliant joints developed can be formulated, for the most part, using linear algebraic equations, allowing for the elimination of the dependent variables at a preprocessing stage, thereby significantly reducing the problem dimension and array storage needed. Furthermore, the constraint equations are automatically satisfied at the position, velocity, and acceleration levels. When using the proposed approach to model large scale chain systems, differences in computational efficiency between the augmented formulation and the recursive methods are eliminated, and the CPU times resulting from the use of the two formulations become similar regardless of the complexity of the system. The elimination of the joint constraint equations and the associated dependent variables also contribute to the solution of a fundamental singularity problem encountered in the analysis of closed loop chains and mechanisms by eliminating the need to repeatedly change the chain or mechanism independent coordinates. It is shown that the concept of the knot multiplicity used in computational geometry methods, such as B-spline and NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline), to control the degree of continuity at the breakpoints is not suited for the formulation of many ideal compliant joints. As explained in this paper, this issue is closely related to the inability of Bspline and NURBS to model structural discontinuities. Another contribution of this paper is demonstrating that large deformation ANCF finite elements can be effective, in some MBS application, in solving small deformation problems. This is demonstrated using a heavily constrained tracked vehicle with flexible link chains. Without using the proposed approach, modeling such a complex system with flexible links can be very challenging. The analysis presented in this paper also demonstrates that adding significant model details does not necessarily imply increasing the complexity of the MBS algorithm.

The improved selective reduced integration schemes are given for uni-dimensional beam problems, with basis functions of order two and three, and can be easily extended to higher orders. The resulting B-spline/NURBS finite elements are free from membrane and transverse shear locking. Moreover, no zero energy modes are generated. The performance of the approach is evaluated on the classical test of a cantilever beam subjected to a distributed moment, and compared to Lagrange under-integrated finite elements. \&copy; 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

  volume = {11},
  copyright = {Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.},
  issn = {17298806},
  abstract = {The detection of lane boundaries on suburban streets using images obtained from video constitutes a challenging task. This is mainly due to the difficulties associated with estimating the complex geometric structure of lane boundaries, the quality of lane markings as a result of wear, occlusions by traffic, and shadows caused by road-side trees and structures. Most of the existing techniques for lane boundary detection employ a single visual cue and will only work under certain conditions and where there are clear lane markings. Also, better results are achieved when there are no other onroad objects present. This paper extends our previous work and discusses a novel lane boundary detection algorithm specifically addressing the abovementioned issues through the integration of two visual cues. The first visual cue is based on stripe-like features found on lane lines extracted using a two-dimensional symmetric Gabor filter. The second visual cue is based on a texture characteristic determined using the entropy measure of the predefined neighbourhood around a lane boundary line. The visual cues are then integrated using a rulebased classifier which incorporates a modified sequential covering algorithm to improve robustness. To separate lane boundary lines from other similar features, a road mask is generated using road chromaticity values estimated from CIE L*a*b* colour transformation. Extraneous points around lane boundary lines are then removed by an outlier removal procedure based on studentized residuals. The lane boundary lines are then modelled with Bezier spline curves. To validate the algorithm, extensive experimental evaluation was carried out on suburban streets and the results are presented. \&copy; 2014 The Author(s). Licensee InTech.},

  abstract = {In numerical analysis the failure of engineering materials is controlled through specifying yield envelopes (or surfaces) that bound the allowable stress in the material. However, each surface is distinct and requires a specific equation describing the shape of the surface to be formulated in each case. These equations impact on the numerical implementation, specifically relating to stress integration, of the models and therefore a separate algorithm must be constructed for each model. This paper presents, for the first time, a way to construct yield surfaces using techniques from non-uniform rational basis spline (NURBS) surfaces, such that any isotropic convex yield envelope can be represented within the same framework. These surfaces are combined with an implicit backward-Euler-type stress integration algorithm to provide a flexible numerical framework for computational plasticity. The algorithm is inherently stable as the iterative process starts and remains on the yield surface throughout the stress integration. The performance of the algorithm is explored using both material point investigations and boundary value analyses demonstrating that the framework can be applied to a variety of plasticity models. \&copy; 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

  volume = {149},
  copyright = {Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.},
  issn = {09204105},
  abstract = {Ilk et al.\&rsquo;s deconvolution algorithm using B-splines involves the Laplace transformation of the convolution equation with respect to production rate and wellbore pressure based on Duhamel principle. However, for common cases, the production rate function has \&ldquo;discontinuity\&rdquo; with respect to production time; it does not satisfy the precondition that the function to be transformed by Laplace transformation should be continuous. This inherent defect may directly cause enormous amount of computational time or even the failure of the numerical Laplace inversion in the deconvolution process. Based on these concerns, a fundamentally improved deconvolution algorithm using B-splines is presented here. In the convolution equation, the wellbore pressure derivative corresponding to constant unit production rate as the target of deconvolution is still represented by weighted summation of second-order B-splines; however, the computation process of the deconvolution is kept in the level of integral in the real time space instead of the Laplace space, for the reason that there will be no continuity requirement for the production rate function in the application of Duhamel principle for the deconvolution computation problem. According to the real production rate history, a technique of piecewise analytical integration is adopted for obtaining the elements of sensitivity matrix of a linear system with respect to weight coefficients; the linear system is generated by substituting the measured wellbore pressure data and corresponding variable production rate data into the convolution equation containing B-splines. The proposed direct analytical solution method of the integration for calculating the elements of the sensitivity matrix can not only guarantee the success of the deconvolution computation, but also can largely enhance the deconvolution computation speed. Moreover, in order to further improve the computation speed, a binary search method is also applied to find which production segments (with constant production rate) the measured wellbore pressure data points locate at in the deconvolution computation process. Another linear system with respect to weight coefficients for the regularization from Ilk et al.\&rsquo;s deconvolution algorithm is appended in order to overcome the effect of data errors. The two linear systems are combined together as an over-determined linear system, which can be solved by the least square method. Eventually, the reconstructed wellbore pressure and its derivative by B-splines corresponding to the constant unit production rate can be obtained. Numerical experimental tests demonstrate that the improved deconvolution algorithm exhibits good accuracy, computation speed and stability of data error tolerance. And the statement on how to perform the regularization when data error exists is also made in order to deconvolve the correct wellbore pressure derivative. The improved deconvolution algorithm is also applied into an actual field example. It is found that the deconvolution results by the improved deconvolution algorithm have good agreement with the ones by Von Schroeter et al.\&rsquo;s deconvolution algorithm and by Levitan et al.\&rsquo;s deconvolution algorithm as a whole; and the feature of typical log-log curves of the wellbore pressure drop and the wellbore pressure derivative corresponding to the improved algorithm is very close to the one of typical log-log curves calculated directly from the wellbore pressure data in the well shut-in period. In addition, through many numerical experimental tests, it is also concluded that as the quantity of data largely increases, the improved Ilk et al.'s deconvolution algorithm exhibits the big advantage in fast computational speed over von Schroeter et al.\&rsquo;s algorithm and Levitan et al.\&rsquo;s algorithm. \&copy; 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new approach of meshless local B-spline based finite difference (FD) method for transient 2D heat conduction problems with nonhomogenous and time-dependent heat sources. In this method, any governing equations are discretized by B-spline approximation which is implemented as a generalized FD technique using local B-spline collocation scheme. The key aspect of the method is that any derivative is stated as neighboring nodal values based on B-spline interpolants. The set of neighboring nodes is allowed to be randomly distributed. This allows enhanced flexibility to be obtained in the simulation. The method is truly meshless as no mesh connectivity is required for field variable approximation or integration. Galerkin implicit scheme is employed for time integration. Several transient 2D heat conduction problems with nonuniform heat sources in arbitrary complex geometries are examined to show the efficacy of the method. Comparison of the simulation results with solutions from other numerical methods in the literature is given. Good agreement with reference numerical methods is obtained. The method is shown to be simple and accurate for the time-dependent problems. Copyright \&copy; 2017 by ASME.},

However, it is more or less difficult when the algorithm is used to the non-homogeneous dynamic systems. The spline precise time-integration method which is based on precise integration and spline function fitting is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the non-homogeneous term is fitted via a set of cubic B-spline functions. The graphs of B-spline functions are exactly the same in shape and only the starting point is different. A highly efficient numerical method for calculating the particular solution to the dynamic system is put forward. With this method, simply solve a dynamic equation of which the non-homogeneous term is a standard B-spline function, then by using the superpose principle, the particular solution is obtained. Together with the general solution which is calculated by the time-integration precise method, the solution satisfying the initial conditions is obtained. This new method avoids the inverse matrix calculations as the particular solution is calculated by numerical quadrature, therefore is valid in general cases. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the validity and efficiency of the algorithm.},

  abstract = {Pottmann et al. propose an iterative optimization scheme for approximating a target curve with a B-spline curve based on square distance minimization, or SDM. The main advantage of SDM is that it does not need a parameterization of data points on the target curve. Starting with an initial B-spline curve, this scheme makes an active B-spline curve converge faster towards the target curve and produces a better approximating B-spline curve than existing methods relying on data point parameterization. However, SDM is sensitive to the initial B-spline curve due to its local nature of optimization. To address this, we integrate SDM with procedures for automatically adjusting both the number and locations of the control points of the active spline curve. This leads to a method that is more robust and applicable than SDM used alone. Furthermore, it is observed that the most time consuming part of SDM is the repeated computation of the foot-point on the target curve of a sample point on the active B-spline curve. In our implementation, we speed up the foot-point computation by pre-computing the distance field of the target curve using the Fast Marching Method. Experimental examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Problems for further research are discussed. \&copy; 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  copyright = {Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.},
  abstract = {To achieve high-speed and high-accuracy machining, look-ahead scheme and parametric interpolator have shown significant effect on interpolating micro-line blocks. On the one hand, look-ahead schemes have been integrated in many computer numerical control (CNC) systems to alleviate the frequent start/stop motion and achieve a higher feedrate. However, the unsmooth speed at the segment junctions cannot be avoided entirely due to the discontinuous nature of the linearized-segmented contour. On the other hand, parametric interpolator has been proposed to overcome the shortcomings of the linear/circular interpolator. But, it is difficult to fit the blocks into parametric curves on-line. In this paper, a local cubic B-spline fitting algorithm with real-time look-ahead scheme is proposed for consecutive micro-line blocks interpolation. First, the consecutive micro-line blocks, which satisfy the bi-chord error constraint, are fitted into a continuous cubic B-spline curve. Second, machining dynamics and tool path contour constrains are taken into consideration. Third, an optimal look-ahead scheme is proposed to generate the optimal feedrate profile. Simulation and experiment are performed in real-time environment to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

  abstract = {The main contribution of this paper is to provide a unified treatment to the problems of constrained minimum-time trajectory generation, fault detection and identification, and (after a fault has been detected and identified) trajectory reconfiguration, in an integrated scheme using a differential flatness and B-splines parameterisation. Using the flatness/B-splines parameterisation the problem of minimum-time constrained trajectory planning is cast into a feasibility-search problem in the splines control-points space, in which the constraint region is characterised by a polytope. A close approximation of the minimum-time trajectory is obtained by systematically searching the end-time that makes the constraint polytope to be minimally feasible. Fault detection is carried out by using B-splines in an FIR filter implementation. Thus, the threetraditionally dealt with separatelyproblems (namely, trajectory generation, fault detection, and trajectory reconfiguration) are solved in a unified manner, using the same mathematical/computational tools. This, not only offers an elegant solution, but also has the potential to simplify the coding of the algorithms for the real-time application of the strategy. All through the paper, a case-study consisting in an input-constrained double-tank system is analysed in order to illustrate the techniques in an intuitive manner. \&copy; 2011 ENGINEERS AUSTRALIA \&amp; AUSTRALIAN OPTICAL.},

  abstract = {In this work, we consider the problem of generating agile maneuver profiles for Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicles in 3D Complex environments. This problem is complicated by the fact that, generation of the dynamically and geometrically feasible flight trajectories for agile maneuver profiles requires search of nonlinear state space of the aircraft dynamics. This work suggests a two layer feasible trajectory/maneuver generation system. Integrated Path planning (considers geometrical, velocity and acceleration constraints) and maneuver generation (considers saturation envelope and attitude continuity constraints) system enables each layer to solve its own reduced order dimensional feasibility problem, thus simplifies the problem and improves the real time implement ability. In Trajectory Planning layer, to solve the time depended path planning problem of an unmanned combat aerial vehicles, we suggest a two step planner. In the first step, the planner explores the environment through a randomized reachability tree search using an approximate line segment model. The resulting connecting path is converted into flight way points through a line-of-sight segmentation. In the second step, every consecutive way points are connected with B-Spline curves and these curves are repaired probabilistically to obtain a geometrically and dynamically feasible path. This generated feasible path is turned in to time depended trajectory with using time scale factor considering the velocity and acceleration limits of the aircraft. Maneuver planning layer is constructed upon multi modal control framework, where the flight trajectories are decomposed to sequences of maneuver modes and associated parameters. Maneuver generation algorithm, makes use of mode transition rules and agility metric graphs to derive feasible maneuver parameters for each mode and overall sequence. Resulting integrated system; tested on simulations for 3D complex environments, gives satisfactory results and promises successful real time implementation. \&copy; 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a robust PI tracking control strategy with mixed H2 and H-infinite performance for general non-Gaussian systems based on the square root B-spline model for the probability density functions (PDFs).The main objective is to design a generalized proportional-integral (PI) control strategy such that the PDF can follow a target one with the enhanced robustness. Different form the previous models, a descriptor time delay system model based on square root B-spline approximation is first established. To enhance the robust performance for the tracking problem, the mixed H2 and H-infinite performance is applied instead of the only H-infinite performance. The novel mixed H2 and H-infinite tracking problem is formulated as a optimization problem. Instead of the non-convex design algorithms, the improved linear-matrix-inequality (LMI) based convex algorithms are also proved for controller design. Furthermore, simulations on particle distribution control problems are given to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach and encouraging results have obtained.

It is noted that the PDF tracking is transformed to a constrained dynamical tracking control problem for weight dynamics. For the non-linear discrete-time weight model including time-delay terms and exogenous disturbances, convex linear matrix inequality optimisation algorithms are used to design a generalised PI controller such that stabilisation, state constraint and tracking performance can be guaranteed simultaneously. Furthermore, in order to enhance the robustness, the peak-to-peak measure index is applied to optimise the tracking performance.

Based an explicit, constructive, and analytical solution of the donating region, the author proposes algorithms of Lagrangian flux calculation (LFC) as algebraic quadratures over the spline-approximated donating regions. This generic formulation yields high accuracies up to the 8th-order both in time and space. As another benefit, LFC leads to a conservative semi-Lagrangian method whose time step size is free of the Eulerian stability constraint C r$<$/inf$>$ \&le 1. The high accuracy and robustness of the proposed LFC algorithms are demonstrated by various numerical tests with Courant numbers ranging from 1 to 10,000 and with accuracies from the 2nd order to the 8th order. LFC might also be useful in designing hybrid Eulerian methods for complex geometries. \&copy; 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Through casting the problem in a recursive framework using the value-iteration procedure, the value functions of every iteration step is approximated with a time-varying multivariate simplex B-spline on a certain state domain of interest. In the collocation scheme, the time-dependent coefficients of the spline function are further approximated with ordinary univariate B-splines to yield a discretization for the value function fully in terms of piece-wise polynomials. The B-spline coefficients are determined by solving a sequence of highly sparse quadratic programming problems. The proposed algorithm is demonstrated on a pair of benchmark example problems. Simulation results indicate that the method can yield increasingly more accurate approximations of the value function by refinement of the triangulation. \&copy; 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

  copyright = {Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.},
  abstract = {This paper presents a novel method for the edge-preserving smoothing of biomedical images. It is based on the convolution of the image with scaled B-splines. The size of the spline convolution kernel at each image position is adaptive and matched to the underlying image characteristics; i.e., wide splines for smooth regions and narrow ones for pixels belonging to edges. Consequently, the algorithm reduces image noise in homogeneous areas while, at the same time, preserving image structures such as edges or corners. We argue that the proposed adaptive filtering strategy provides a good balance between the improvement in the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and perceptual quality. Our algorithm takes advantage of the unique convolution and factorization properties of B-splines. Specifically, the input signal is expressed in a B-spline basis; the inner product with a B-spline of arbitrary size is then computed by using an adequate combination of ID integrations (preprocessing) and rescaled finite differences. The method is computationally efficient with a cost per pixel that is fixed and independent upon the scaling factor. \&copy; 2007 Taylor \&amp; Francis Group.},

A higher-order B-spline Rankine panel method is used to represent the effects of the fluid motion surrounding this flexible seagoing vessel, and a finite element formulation based on Vlasov beam is employed for structural response. The boundary integral equation and finite element equation, both for fluid and structural domains, are fully coupled with each other using an iterative implicit method in the time domain. Coupling between the two field equations is achieved by relying on fixed-point iteration with relaxation aided by Aitken's \&delta;\textsuperscript{2} process to maximize convergence speed. The steady-unsteady coupling term or m-term in the linearized body boundary condition derived by Timman and Newman is taken into account for accurate prediction of flexible body motion when forward speed is present. The 2nd derivative of basis potential in the m-term is obtained by modifying Nakos approach, which was originally developed using the Stokes theorem for rigid body ship motion problem. For the solution of the FE equation, instead of conventionally used modal superposition method, a direct integration scheme based on Newmark method is employed. It is believed that this technique is more attractive in the sense that it allows us free from the selection of optimum number of mode-shapes in the computation. \&copy; 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We propose flexible high-accuracy practical techniques to perform 3D and 2D integral transformations from potential field components to potential and from potential-field gradient components to potential field components in the space domain using cubic B-splines. The spline techniques are applicable to either uniform or non-uniform rectangular grids for the 3D case, and applicable to either regular or irregular grids for the 2D case. The spline-based indefinite integrations can be computed at any point in the computational domain. In our synthetic 3D gravity and magnetic transformation examples, we show that the spline techniques are substantially more accurate than the Fourier transform techniques, and demonstrate that harmonicity is confirmed substantially better for the spline method than the Fourier transform method and that spline-based integration and differentiation are invertible. The cost of the increase in accuracy is an increase in computing time. Our real data examples of 3D transformations show that the spline-based results agree substantially better or better with the observed data than do the Fourier-based results. The spline techniques would therefore be very useful for data quality control through comparisons of the computed and observed components. If certain desired components of the potential field or gradient data are not measured, they can be obtained using the spline-based transformations as alternatives to the Fourier transform techniques. \&copy; 2012 European Association of Geoscientists \&amp; Engineers.},

The approximation has been constructed previously for full-turn maps of large particle accelerators, and a large saving in time (for instance a factor of 60) has been demonstrated. A shortcoming of our work to date arises from the use of canonical polar coordinates, which preclude map construction in small regions of phase space near coordinate singularities. Here, we show that Cartesian coordinates can be used, thus avoiding singularities. The generator is represented in a basis of tensor product B-splines. Under weak conditions, the spline expansion converges uniformly as the mesh is refined, approaching the generator of the Poincare map as defined by the symplectic integrator, in some parallelepiped of phase space centered at the origin.},

  abstract = {A fully coupled time-domain ship hydroelasticity problem focusing on a springing phenomenon is considered in this study using a hybrid boundary element method (BEM) finite element method (FEM) scheme. The fluid domain surrounding a flexible vessel is handled with a boundary element method adopting a higher-order B-spline Rankine panel method. The structural domain is modeled by a finite element method relying on the one-dimensional beam element, which is able to capture the coupling effect between torsion and bending as well as warping distortion. Coupling between the two subdomains is realized by the Newton method in which an exact Jacobian matrix is derived by solving both fluid and structure tangent problems. The calculation is repeated until the solution reaches convergence. Thanks to the positive aspects of this implicit scheme, numerical instability related to the time integration can be avoided without relying on infinite frequency added mass, which is inevitable when an explicit scheme is used. Moreover, a direct integration scheme, such as the Newmark-p method, for structural problems can be used, and this formulation can be easily extended to the case with structural nonlinear effect, such as large deformation. The developed computer program is validated through comparison with published experimental data, ending up with good correspondence between the two results. Validation is also achieved through a comparative study on rigid body motion with an existing six degrees of freedom (6-DOF) ship motion program.},

  abstract = {The dynamic behaviour of wood machining processes affects the surface finish quality of machined workpieces. In order to meet the requirements of increased production efficiency and improved product quality, surface quality information is needed for enhanced process control. However, current methods using high price devices or sophisticated designs, may not be suitable for industrial real-time application. This paper presents a novel approach of surface quality evaluation by on-line vibration analysis using an adaptive spline wavelet algorithm, which is based on the excellent time-frequency localization of B-spline wavelets. A series of experiments have been performed to extract the feature, which is the correlation between the relevant frequency band(s) of vibration with the change of the amplitude and the surface quality. The graphs of the experimental results demonstrate that the change of the amplitude in the selective frequency bands with variable resolution (linear and non-linear) reflects the quality of surface finish, and the root sum square of wavelet power spectrum is a good indication of surface quality. Thus, surface quality can be estimated and quantified at an average level in real time. The results can be used to regulate and optimize the machine's feed speed, maintaining a constant spindle motor speed during cutting. This will lead to higher level control and machining rates while keeping dimensional integrity and surface finish within specification.},

  abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) dynamic stress concentration problems are analyzed using the wavelet Galerkin method (WGM). Linear B-spline scaling/wavelet functions are employed. We introduce enrichment functions for the X-FEM to represent a crack geometry. In the WGM, low-resolution scaling functions are periodically located across the entire analysis domain to approximate deformations of a body. High-resolution wavelet functions and enrichment functions including crack tip singular fields are superposed on the scaling functions to represent the severe stress concentration around holes or crack tips. Heaviside functions are also enriched to treat the displacement discontinuity of the crack face. Multiresolution analysis of the wavelet basis functions plays an important role in the WGM. To simulate the transients, the wavelet Galerkin formulation is discretized using a Newmark-\&beta; time integration scheme. A path independent J-integral is adopted to evaluate the dynamic stress intensity factor (DSIF). We solve dynamic stress concentration problems and evaluate DSIF of 2D cracked solids. The accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method are discussed through the numerical examples. \&copy; 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Real-time 3D echocardiography (RT3DE) is a non-invasive imaging modality used to provide diagnostic information about cardiac morphology and function. Unfortunately, manual analysis of these datasets remains cumbersome and time-consuming. Our team recently proposed a generic framework for automatic 3D segmentation of volumetric datasets (B-spline explicit active surfaces, BEAS). However, as fully automatic segmentation can (locally) fail, the option of manually correcting the segmentation result should be available for optimal clinical routine use. The aim of this study was to develop an interactive segmentation method by embedding the user input in the segmentation framework. In order to validate the proposed method, a database consisting of 10 3D echocardiographic images from open-chest sheep experiments was used. Two experts segmented the data, using a purely manual approach as well as the proposed interactive framework. Using the interactive approach, the RT3DE data could be analyzed in a more time efficient manner (analysis time, interactive: 44.7 \&plusmn; 11.9s vs. manual: 181.5 \&plusmn; 66.2s; p \&lt; 0.001), while being an equally accurate alternative to manual contouring. Moreover, it improved the reproducibility of the extracted measurements (inter-observer variability, interactive: 3.1 \&plusmn; 2.4ml vs. manual: 6.0 \&plusmn; 2.7ml; p \&lt; 0.05). \&copy; 2012 IEEE.},

  abstract = {B-Splines, in general, and Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS), in particular, have become indispensable modeling primitives in computer graphics and geometric modeling applications. In this paper, a novel high-performance architecture for the computation of uniform, nonuniform, rational, and nonrational B-Spline curves and surfaces is presented. This architecture has been derived through a sequence of steps. First, a systolic architecture for the computation of the basis function values, the basis function evaluation array (the BFEA), is developed. Using the BFEA as its core, an architecture for the computation of NURBS curves is constructed. This architecture is then extended to compute NURBS surfaces. Finally, this architecture is augmented to compute the surface normals, so that the output from this architecture can be directly used for rendering the NURBS surface. The overall linear structure of the architecture, its small I/O requirements, its nondependence on the size of the problem (in terms of the number of control points and the number of points on the curve/surface that have to be computed), and its very high throughput make this architecture highly suitable for integration into the standard graphics pipeline of high-end workstations. Results of the timing analysis indicate a potential throughput of one triangle with the normal vectors at its vertices, every two clock cycles.},

  abstract = {B-spline collocation is a method for approximating solutions to differential equations. The method is based on using advanced geometric functions that have become the standard for use with solid modeling codes to represent complex curves and surfaces. B-spline collocation promises to be a faster method than traditional methods for two primary reasons. First, it is a meshless method, thus avoiding the need to generate a mesh, and second, it can represent a complex solution with far fewer data than traditional finite volume, finite difference methods, leading to smaller problem matrices that should be quicker to solve. The method also has the capacity to provide very accurate solutions. The scope of the present work has been to develop the necessary parts of solution algorithms to begin to determine how effective and efficient B-spline collocation is, and to apply the method to a simple fluid dynamic problem. The differential terms of the equation are computed analytically at any point to determine equation residuals. The points where residuals are evaluated are called collocation points. The necessary parts of the solution algorithm include the basic solution approach, definition of residuals, the collocation points, and scaling. Each of these issues is addressed leading to the attainment of reasonable solutions using multiple solution schemes. Although the solution algorithm cannot yet be considered to be optimal, the time needed for a solution is about half the time used by an optimized commercial code. Comparative results are reported for a simple fluid dynamics test problem.},

Design/methodology/approach - In the present method, any governing equations are discretized by B-spline approximation which is implemented in the spirit of FD technique using a local B-spline collocation scheme. The key aspect of the method is that any derivative is stated as neighbouring nodal values based on B-spline interpolants. The set of neighbouring nodes are allowed to be randomly distributed thus enhanced flexibility in the numerical simulation can be obtained. The method requires no mesh connectivity at all for either field variable approximation or integration. Time integration is performed by using the Crank-Nicolson implicit time stepping technique. Findings - Several heat conduction problems in complex domains which represent for extended surfaces in industrial applications are examined to demonstrate the effectiveness of the present approach. Comparison of the obtained results with solutions from other numerical method available in literature is given. Excellent agreement with reference numerical method has been found. Research limitations/implications - The method is presented for 2D problems. Nevertheless, it would be also applicable for 3D problems. Practical implications - A transient two dimensional heat conduction in complex domains which represent for extended surfaces in industrial applications is presented.

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a general technique for robust modeling of non-planar ground surfaces. It is based on representing the ground plane as a parametric B-Spline surface and on robust tracking of the surface parameters using stereo disparities and a Kalman filter. We adopt a recently published real-time optimization algorithm for finding the road-obstacle boundary to integrate disparity values. The results show that in situations where a planar road assumption yields wrong results due to undulating roads, our approach is able to distinguish between free space and obstacles. \&copy; 2008 IEEE.},

  abstract = {As product varieties increase and life cycles shorten, the need to reduce product development time becomes more critical to maintain competitiveness in the market. The reduction of the product development time, therefore, requires revolutionary improvements rather than gradual changes in technology. Based on a novel strategy the procedure for integration of reverse engineering and rapid prototyping was developed in this paper. Direct integration of reverse engineering and rapid prototyping is not a new issue and its importance has been demonstrated by many authors. However, all traditional algorithms for integration of RE and RP operate on scattered points directly such that some useful information for example curvature, normal and geometric shape, which are necessary for adaptive slicing in RP, cannot be obtained. To resolve the difficult dilemma a new algorithm is developed to build a bridge between scattered points and adaptive slicing. \&copy; 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  issn = {03608352},
  abstract = {In this paper, we present a methodology for automating the process planning and NC code generation for a widely encountered class of free-form features that can be machined on a 3-axis mill-turn center. The free-form feature family that is considered is that of extruded protrusions whose cross-section is a closed, periodic B-Spline curve. In this methodology, for machining a part with B-Spline protrusion located at the free end, the part is first rough turned to the maximum profile diameter of the B-Spline, followed by rough profile cutting and finish profiling with axially mounted end mill tools. The identification and sequencing of machining volumes is completely automated, as is the generation of actual NC code. The approach supports both convex and non-convex profiles. In the case of non-convex profiles, the process planning algorithm ensures that there is no gouging of the work piece by the tool. The algorithm also identifies when sections of the tool path lie outside the work piece and utilizes rapid traverses in these regions to reduce cutting time. This methodology presents an integrated turn-mill process planning where by making the process fully automated from design with no user intervention making the overall process planning efficient. The algorithm was tested on several examples and test parts using the unmodified NC code obtained from the implementation were run on a Moriseiki mill-turn center. The parts that were produced met the dimensional specifications of the desired part. \&copy; 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Computer assisted analysis of organs has an important role in clinical diagnosis and therapy planning. As well as the visualization, the manipulation of 3-dimensional (3D) objects are key features of medical image processing tools. The goal of this work was to develop an efficient and easy to use tool that allows the physician to partition a segmented organ into its segments or lobes.The proposed tool allows the user to define a cutting surface by drawing some traces on 2D sections of a 3D object, cut the object into two pieces with a smooth surface that fits the input traces, and iterate the process until the object is partitioned at the desired level. The tool is based on an algorithm that interpolates the user-defined traces with B-spline surface and computes a binary cutting volume that represents the different sides of the surface. The computation of the cutting volume is based on the multi-resolution triangulation of the B-spline surface.The proposed algorithm was integrated into an open-source medical image processing framework. Using the tool, the user can select the object to be partitioned (e.g. segmented liver), define the cutting surface based on the corresponding medical image (medical image visualizing the internal structure of the liver), cut the selected object, and iterate the process. In case of liver segment separation, the cuts can be performed according to a predefined sequence, which makes it possible to label the temporary as well as the final partitions (lobes, segments) automatically.The presented tool was evaluated for anatomical segment separation of the liver involving 14 cases and virtual liver tumor resection involving one case. The segment separation was repeated 3 different times by one physician for all cases, and the average and the standard deviation of segment volumes were computed. According to the test experiences the presented algorithm proved to be efficient and user-friendly enough to perform free form cuts for liver segment separation and virtual liver tumor resection. The volume quantification of segments showed good correlation with the prior art and the vessel-based liver segment separation, which demonstrate the clinical usability of the presented method. \&copy; 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

  issn = {15551415},
  abstract = {In this investigation, a numerical procedure for modeling sliding and nonsliding joint constraints for the B-spline thin plate element is developed for the large deformation analysis of multibody systems. A concept of intermediate reference coordinates proposed for the absolute nodal coordinate formulation is generalized for B-spline elements such that a wide variety of joint constraints can be modeled using existing joint constraint libraries already implemented in multibody dynamics codes. This procedure allows for modeling sliding joints for B-spline elements that requires a solution to moving boundary problems by introducing time-variant surface parameters in the B-spline parametric domain. Since surface parameters treated as knot variables in the basis function are defined in the entire parametric domain rather than the element domain, the location of the constraint definition point can be determined without knowing in which elements the sliding point is located. Furthermore, using the B-spline recurrence formula, control points used for describing the constraint equations can be systematically extracted. It is shown that many types of nonsliding joints fixed on the flexible body can also be modeled as a special case of the sliding joint formulation developed in this investigation, leading to a unified joint constraint formulation for B-spline elements. Several numerical examples are presented in order to demonstrate the use of the numerical procedure developed in this investigation. \&copy; 2014 by ASME.},

A boundary element method based on a B-spline expansion is used to calculate the wave field at each time step, and numerical integration in time has been applied for predicting boundary conditions on the free water surface and the body surface at the next time step. An artificial damping layer is adopted on the free surface to avoid the wave reflection. Additionally, a mathematical transform is used to remove the second spatial derivative in the body surface boundary condition. Numerical results of hydrodynamic forces are presented for the case of a truncated surface-piercing circular cylinder undergoing specified sinusoidal surge and heave motions.

Motion computations in head waves are carried out for three types of ship hulls: a mathematically defined Wigley hull, a typical containership (S175 hull), and a Series 60 hull. Results are obtained for regular and irregular waves and compared with available experimental and computational results. It is found that the results from the present method are in very good agreement with the published results, and in particular with experimental data.

  volume = {49},
  copyright = {Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.},
  abstract = {This article proposes a B-spline-decomposition-based approach to output tracking with preview for nonminimum-phase (NMP) systems. It has been shown that when there exists a finite (in time) preview of future desired trajectory, precision output tracking of NMP systems can be achieved by using the preview-based stable-inversion technique. The performance of this approach, however, can be sensitive to system dynamics uncertainty, and the computation involved can be demanding. We propose to address these challenges by integrating the notion of trajectory decomposition with the iterative learning control (ILC) technique. Particularly, the B-splines are used to construct a library of output elements and the corresponding input elements a priori, and the ILC techniques are used to obtain the input elements for precision tracking of the output elements. During the tracking with preview, the previewed future desired trajectory is decomposed by using the output elements, and the input is synthesized by using the corresponding input elements with chosen pre- and post-actuation times. The required pre-/post-actuation times are quantified based on the stable-inversion theory. The use of B-splines substantially reduces the number of output elements in the library, and the decomposition-synthesis occurs only at time instants separated by the difference between the preview time and pre-actuation time. The proposed approach is illustrated through a simulation study of nanomanipulation application using a NMP piezo actuator model. \&copy; 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In this way the carrier signals have not to be really synthesized, hence the hardware and the whole inverter control system becomes cheaper, more reliable and affordable.

Consequently, this method effectively minimizes the number of internal knots for any given trajectory, thus effectively improving the computation efficiency of the path fitness evaluation and hence path planning. The proposed method is integrated with a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based path planner and tested to generate an optimal trajectory for an AUV travelling through a turbulent ocean field in scenarios with uncertainty in position estimates.

  abstract = {In this paper we present a novel controller for Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) actuated robotic systems. The new controller, called BAC (B-spline based Adaptive Control), is based on a hybrid combination of gain scheduling, B-spline approximation, variable structure control and integral control. The proposed controller shows excellent positioning accuracy and speed throughout the full range of motion of a SMA actuated robotic system in large-scale applications. To demonstrate the validity of BAC, a novel anthropomorphic SMA Actuated forearm / wrist mechanism is utilized in real-time PC based control experiments.

  abstract = {Based on the separable wavelet theory, the scaling functions of one-dimensional B-spline wavelet on the interval (BSWI) is employed to construct the two-dimensional B-spline wavelet bases on the interval. In order to solve the GPR wave equation, these constructed wavelet bases are used as the interpolation functions, and a transformation matrix is introduced to convert between the wavelet coefficient space and the physical space (radar electromagnetic field). In this study, the discrete format of GPR wave equation for two-dimensional interval B-spline wavelet finite element is derived using Galerkin algorithm. And the integral values and the connection coefficients of the second order one-scale and second order two-scale BSWI functions are calculated. The detailed process of the algorithm is given. Then two typical examples are forward modeled using the BSWI method by Matlab program. The result shows that the BSWI with fewer units has the same precision as FEM. Increasing the scale of BSWI algorithm, the precision of the results is also improved, but it is time-consuming. Finally, the BSWI algorithm is applied to model bi-phase random concrete medium, and it proves that the random medium model theory can describe the practical distribution of concrete medium flexibly and effectively. Furthermore, this study found that the forward modeling profile is more accordant with practical profile, which demonstrates that medium model theory can simulate the transmission process of the radar wave more accurately. It also provides a theoretical basis for improving the detection results and interpretation accuracy of GPR. \&copy; 2016, Science Press. All right reserved.},

Moreover, the analysis for the performances of the proposed wavelets reveals that the wavelets possess smaller supports in general cases compared with that of semiorthogonal nonuniform B-spline wavelets, with good approximation property and suitable for any uniform and nonuniform nested sequences of knot vectors. Several examples are given for the applications of the proposed wavelets in the MRA of nonuniform B-spline curves. The experimental results show that as any other nonuniform B-spline wavelets, the proposed wavelets provide greater flexibility than uniform B-spline wavelets do for the applications of the MRA of B-spline curves and surfaces.

By exploiting the dynamic filters for the B-spline trajectory planning, it has been possible to integrate the trajectory generation within a repetitive control scheme able to modify in real-time the reference signal with the aims of nullify interpolation errors.

The CEMDTS, the leapfrog central difference method, the Newmark method, the generalized-a method and the precise integration method were implemented in typical nonlinear examples for the purpose of comparison. Both conservative and non-conservative systems were examined. The results show that it isn't unconditionally stable for the precise integration method, the Newmark method and the generalized-a method in nonlinear systems. The stable interval of the three methods is less than that of the CEMDTS. When a small time step(?t$\leq$Tmin/20) is employed, the precise integration method is endowed with the highest accuracy while the CEMDTS possesses the smallest computation effort. However, the CEMDTS becomes the most accurate one when the time step is large(?t$\geq$0.3Tmin) or the system is strongly nonlinear. Therefore, the CEMDTS is more applicable to the nonlinear vibration systems.},

Element and nodal time steps are presented and adapted to highly regular B-spline and NURBS functions, in the context of isogeometric analysis. The size of the proposed stable time estimates benefits from the properties of regularity and extended support of the basis. Their performance is assessed and compared in several examples, with an arbitrary mesh, uniform or non-uniform, and considering polynomial orders from one to five. The smoothness and order of the polynomials have a significant effect on the stable time step and its estimates.

We apply cubic B-splines for spatial variable and its derivatives, which produce a system of first order ordinary differential equations. We solve this system by using SSP-RK3 scheme. The numerical approximate solutions to the nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations have been computed without transforming the equation and without using the linearization. Four illustrative examples are included to demonstrate the validity and applicability of the technique. In numerical test problems, the performance of this method is shown by computing L$\infty$andL2error norms for different time levels.

The motion of the droplet is coupled with the motion of the component or chip to be assembled and involves dynamic contact lines. A methodology based on a Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) discretization has been developed for the dynamic analysis of the droplet motion. A surface energy based formulation has been developed to incorporate the surface tension effects. The developed methodology leads to an updated Lagrangian scheme with a Galerkin in space and Least square in time formulation. The Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) representation used for the spatial discretization enables the method to handle problems involving complex droplet geometries. The ability of the NURBS representation to provide both global and local control, along with the least square method used in this methodology, enables us to develop an unconditionally stable time integration scheme which can be optimized to achieve desired accuracy and numerical dissipation efficiently. A sample problem of droplet shape evolution has been solved to demonstrate the path prediction capability of the proposed methodology.

Specifically, let x(t), a less than or equal t less than or equal b, denote the input to an analog filter F, and y(t), a less than or equal t less than or equal b the corresponding output of F. We assume that the input x belongs to a class C of signals generated by a linear dynamical system, characterized by an m\textsuperscript{th} order linear differential operator L(D), D = d/dt, driven by inputs of bounded energy. On this basis, we obtain the best discrete-time approximation F* to the analog filter F by interpolating the samples x(t\textsubscript{1}),...,x(t\textsubscript{n}) of x(t) by a generalized L-spline S(t) (corresponding to the differential operator L(D)), and then convolving S(t) with the impulse response of the analog filter F. This provides the optimal mapping F* (in min-max error sense) of the samples x(t\textsubscript{1}),...,x(t\textsubscript{n}) into the best approximation y*(t\textsubscript{1}),...,y*(t\textsubscript{n}) of the samples y(t\textsubscript{1}),...,y(t\textsubscript{n}) of F.},

The NURBS surfaces are expanded in terms of rational Bezier patches by applying the Cox-De Boor transform algorithm. This transformation is justified because Bezier patches are numerically more stable than NURBS surfaces. The PO integral is evaluated over the parametric space of the Bezier surfaces using asymptotic integration. The scattering field contribution of each Bezier patch is expressed in terms of its geometric parameters. Excellent agreement with PO predictions is obtained. The method is quite efficient because it makes use of a small number of patches to model complex bodies, so it requires very little memory and computing time.},

So-called quadratic B-Splines are introduced as a generalisation of the well-known rectangular and triangle expansion functions. The thin-wire version of the electric-field integral equation (EFIE) is solved by the Method of Moments (MoM) using Galerkin's method. The described procedure results in a symmetrical structure of the impedance matrix, which allows the application of symmetric solvers with the benefit of a very effective solving procedure. Due to the choice of the expansion and weighting functions the results are very precise for near-fields and points near the structure. It become possible to investigate structures with very small separations between the wires. Numerical examples demonstrate the suitability of the method for the EMC-analysis and show the advantages of a reduced solving time in the analysis of large systems and a lower limit for the shortest separation between two wires.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this research has been to develop and evaluate procedures for the mathematical modeling of hull forms. This has been accomplished through the application and integration of high-level computer graphics technology into the design process. High-level computer graphics are characterized by the ability to manipulate a realistically rendered image of a three-dimensional object, with a colored and shaded surface, in real time. The hull forms studied are appropriate to hard chine and round bilge small craft. The first interactive graphics program has been developed for the definition of developable hull surfaces such as the hard chine hull. Control curves, including the keel chine and sheer lines, are faired interactively through real-time graphical techniques on the workstation using the Curve Fairing Tool (CFT) program. A developable surface is then generated between the control curves using the Developable surface Definition Tool (DSDT). B-spline mathematical techniques have been found to be particularly useful for defining complex three-dimensional sculpted surfaces, such as the round bilge hull. A second interactive graphics program, SPLINE, has been developed which facilitates the interactive definition of the B-spline control graph and real-time manipulation of the model image. Finally, a technique has been developed for in situ measurements of an existing hull form which might serve for example, as a 'parent' for further development using either DSDT or SPLINE. The procedure is based on the use of laser light striping techniques to illuminate surface contours, in conjunction with video image recording. A processing procedure then applies inverse homogeneous coordinate transformations to obtain the planar contour coordinates which are used to define the surface geometry. This research is being conducted at the Computer-Aided Design Technology (CADTECH) research laboratory in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Washington.},

In the case of an FIR (finite-impulse-response) digital filter, it has been found that a B-spline representation of the filter response leads to minimal time and circuit complexities. The number of filter coefficients required in this implementation is reduced and corresponds to the lower sampling rate of the filter function. The aliasing usually associated with this lower sampling rate is substantially reduced by processing the input data with a prefilter which can be interpreted as an interpolator. The prefilter is implemented using a cascade of running average filters which requires no multipliers. The B-spline approach is suited to VLSI implementation and leads to substantial reductions in circuit complexity.},

This paper describes a hybrid current controller for the linear compressors. It comprises a conventional proportional-integral (PI) controller, and a B-spline neural network compensator which is trained on-line and in real-time in order to minimize the current tracking error under all conditions with uncertain disturbances. It has been shown that the hybrid current controller has a superior steady-state and transient performance over the conventional carrier based PI controller. The performance of the proposed hybrid controller has been demonstrated by extensive simulations and experiments. It has also been shown that the linear compressor operates stably under the current feedback control and the piston stroke can be adjusted by varying the amplitude of the current command. \&copy; 2007 IEEE.},

  issn = {10871357},
  abstract = {This paper presents a parameterization and an interpolation method for quintic splines, which result in a smooth and consistent feed rate profile. The discrepancy between the spline parameter and the actual arc length leads to undesirable feed fluctuations and discontinuity, which elicit themselves as high frequency acceleration and jerk harmonics, causing unwanted structural vibrations and excessive tracking error. Two different approaches are presented that alleviate this problem. The first approach is based on modifying the spline tool path so that it is optimally parameterized with respect to its arc length, which allows it to be accurately interpolated in real-time with minimal complexity. The second approach is based on scheduling the spline parameter to accurately yield the desired arc displacement (hence feed rate), either by approximation of the relationship between the arc length and the spline parameter with a feed correction polynomial, or by solving the spline parameter iteratively in real-time at each interpolation step. This approach is particularly suited for predetermined spline tool paths, which are not arc-length parameterized and cannot be modified. The proposed methods have been compared to approximately arc-length C\textsuperscript{3} quintic spline parameterization (Wang, F.-C., Wright, P. K., Barsky, B. A., and Yang, D. C.

The creation of complex NURBS in design environments is a tedious process because very few tools exist, that allow a designer to design intuitively in real-time. Standard input devices such as the mouse and the keyboard do not provide the designer with direct and easy capabilities for surface manipulation. We have developed a NURBS modeling system that allows the designer to edit NURBS surfaces in realtime using a pressure sensitive sculpting/molding input device designed to be worn as a glove called the ModelGlove. This input device is equipped with force and position sensors for quantifying touch and intent of the designer. A virtual block deforms in a physically realistic manner in response to the user's direct manipulation of a hard or soft real physical object. The dynamic behavior of the NURBS model in response to the force and position input obtained from the ModelGlove, produces highly natural shape variations.

The control aims at making the statistical information of the output pdfs to follow those of a target pdf. For such a control framework, a variable structure adaptive tracking control strategy is first established using two-step neural network models. Following the B-spline neural network approximation to the integrated performance function, the concerned problem is transferred into the tracking of given weights. The dynamic neural network (DNN) is employed to identify the unknown nonlinear dynamics between the control input and the weights related to the integrated function. To achieve the required control objective, an adaptive controller based on the proposed DNN is developed so as to track a reference trajectory. Stability analysis for both the identification and tracking errors is developed via the use of Lyapunov stability criterion. Simulations are given to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach. \&copy; 2009 IEEE.},

When compared with the gridpoint representation, the cubic-spline representation allows direct evaluation of derivatives in the model equations, and leads to a substantial reduction of shortwave dispersion of advecting and propagating waves. When compared with the Fourier spectral representation, the cubic B-splines as basis functions provide simple but exact means of implementing a variety of boundary conditions that are needed at the domain interfaces, as well as at natural boundaries. A sharp (sixth order) low-pass filter, which is built into the cubic-spline transform, effectively eliminates adverse nonlinear accumulation of small-scale errors near the resolution limit.

  abstract = {Reverse engineering is an approach for constructing a CAD model from a physical part through dimensional measurement and surface model. For sheetmetal parts, when removed from dies after forming, are subject to springback due the resultant in-plane forces and moments throughout the sheet at the end of the forming processing. Therefore, springback should be compensated for integrating reverse engineering into the system of forming sheet metal with a complex surface. However, CAD modelling from measured points data is a roadblock to the automation of the duplication procedure. The difficulties here arise from surfaces fitting to measured points, which is well-known to be time-consuming. To avoid the roadblock, based on the convex hull property of B-spline, a new strategy for direct generation of die shapes from digitized points with springback compensation is presented in this paper. The proposed algorithm has been applied to a part of complicated geometry with good results. \&copy; Springer-Verlag London Limited 2006.},

  issn = {1569190X},
  abstract = {In fluid power system simulation, orifice flow is, in the main, clearly in the turbulent area. Only when a valve is closed or an actuator driven against an end stopper does the flow become laminar as pressure drop over the orifice approaches zero. So, in terms of accuracy, the description of laminar flow is hardly necessary. Unfortunately, when a purely turbulent description of the orifice is used, numerical problems occur when pressure drop becomes close to zero since the first derivative of flow with respect of pressure drop approaches infinity when pressure drop approaches zero. Furthermore, the second derivative becomes discontinuous, which causes numerical noise and an infinitely small integration step when a variable step integrator is used. In this paper, a numerically efficient model for the orifice flow is proposed using a cubic spline function to describe the flow in the laminar and transition areas. Parameters for the cubic spline are selected such that its first derivative is equal to the first derivative of the pure turbulent orifice flow model in the boundary condition. The key advantage of this model comes from the fact that no geometrical data is needed in calculation of flow from the pressure drop. In real-time simulation of fluid power circuits, a trade-off exists between accuracy and calculation speed. This investigation is made for the two-regime flow orifice model. The effect of selection of transition pressure drop and integration time step on the accuracy and speed of solution is investigated. \&copy; 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The dynamic motion of a solder droplet during assembly is a complex, unsteady, free surface problem involving surface tension and viscous effects. The motion of the droplet is coupled with the motion of the component or chip to be assembled and involves dynamic contact lines. A methodology based on a non-uniform rational b-spline (NURBS) discretization has been developed for the dynamic analysis of the droplet motion. A surface energy based formulation has been developed to incorporate the surface tension effects. The developed methodology leads to an updated Lagrangian scheme with a Galerkin in space and Least square in time formulation. The NURBS representation used for the spatial discretization enables the method to handle problems involving complex droplet geometries. The ability of the NURBS representation to provide both global and local control, along with the least square method used in this methodology, enables us to develop an unconditionally stable time integration scheme which can be optimized to achieve desired accuracy and numerical dissipation efficiently. A sample problem of droplet shape evolution has been solved to demonstrate the path prediction capability of the proposed methodology. In future, the method can be applied to solve various real world dynamic motion problems associated with droplets.},

  abstract = {Reconflgurable guidance and control are major keys for reliable and safe planetary entry of space exploration vehicles. Major challenges in these missions are posed by uncertainties in atmospheric properties like density and winds. A guidance algorithm based on optimal control theory and integrated with a nonlinear Structured Adaptive Model Inversion controller is developed, implemented and evaluated in this paper. The guidance algorithm uses B-spline parametrization of states to generate dynamically feasible optimal trajectories which steer the vehicle from entry interface conditions to a Final Approach Corridor, while simultaneously satisfying terminal conditions. Guidance trajectory acts as a reference trajectory for nonlinear adaptive controller which further generates the commanded moments based on reference input. Reaction control jet selection is accomplished using discrete control allocation. Discrete control allocation method can also handle various types of control failures. Performance is evaluated with a Mars Ellipsled vehicle non real-time simulation for a complete Mars entry trajectory tracking scenario. Simulation results presented in the paper demonstrate that the guidance algorithm generates the optimal trajectory under various terminal constraints while the fault tolerant control algorithm satisfactorily track this optimal trajectory in the presence of plant and environment uncertainties, in addition to control failures.

The approach to the solution of these equations, and hence the construction of suitable methods, that we will describe in this paper, is based on computation of the coefficients of the stability polynomial by a variant of the Fourier series method and solving the resulting systems of polynomial equations by least squares minimization. Examples of explicit and implicit methods of order 5 and 6 are given which are appropriate for nonstiff or stiff differential systems in a sequential computing environment. The coefficients of these methods were obtained numerically with the aid of lmdif. f and lmder. f from MINPACK. These programs minimize the sum of the squares of nonlinear functions by a modification of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. The derived explicit and implicit methods have the same stability properties as explicit Runge-Kutta and \{SDIRK\} methods, respectively, of the same order.},

In particular, its possible use for delay differential equations is being taken into account in the design. What seems to be needed is a means of calculating approximate solution values outside a current step by interpolation from information generated when previous steps were being worked through. In a solver of conventional design, there is also needed a means of making this data from previous steps available to the subroutine which computes the right-hand side of the delay differential equation. In STRIDE, interpolation within a current step is carried out using an expansion in a modified form of Taylor series, in which Laguerre polynomials take the place of the usual powers of the offset from the beginning of the current step. This is inappropriate for later use in computing delays and part of the content of this paper deals with a transformation of the data to a more convenient form. The other main topic discussed will be the use of reverse communication to allow flexibility of usage and to allow the extension to delay problems particularly straightforward.},

Some methods, with 1 $\leqslant$ p $\leqslant$ 4 , are proved to be optimal, whereas others are obtained by a numerical search. We present closed-form expressions for two families of \{SDIRK\} methods (with s $\geqslant$ 3 ) which we conjecture to be optimal for p = 2 and p = 3 , respectively. Furthermore we prove, for strongly stable \{SDIRK\} methods, the order barrier p $\leqslant$ 4 . We perform numerical experiments, to compare the theoretical properties of various optimal \{SDIRK\} methods to the actual \{TVD\} properties in the solution of a nonlinear test equation, the 1-dimensional Buckley\textendash{}Leverett equation.},

  abstract = {In the recent decade, practical of wavelet technique is being utilized in various domain of science. Particularly, engineers are interested to the wavelet solution method in the time series analysis. Fundamentally, seismic responses of structures against time history loading such as an earthquake, illustrates optimum capability of systems. In this paper, a procedure using particularly discrete Haar wavelet basis functions is introduced, to solve dynamic equation of motion. In the proposed approach, a straightforward formulation in a fluent manner is derived from the approximation of the displacements. For this purpose, Haar operational matrix is derived and applied in the dynamic analysis. It's free-scaled matrix converts differential equation of motion to the algebraic equations. It is shown that accuracy of dynamic responses relies on, access of load in the first step, before piecewise analysis added to the technique of equation solver in the last step for large scale of wavelet. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this scheme, improved formulations are extended to the linear and nonlinear structural dynamic analysis. The validity and effectiveness of the developed method is verified with three examples. The results were compared with those from the numerical methods such as Duhamel integration, Runge-Kutta and Wilson-theta method.},

The main focus is on adjusting the mass matrix. Two well known discretization methods, described in FEM textbooks since the late 1960s, lead to diagonally lumped and consistent mass matrices, respectively. Those models are sufficient to cover many engineering applications but for some problems they fall short. The gap can be filled with a more general approach that relies on the use of templates. These are algebraic forms that carry free parameters. Templates have the virtue of producing a set of mass matrices that satisfy certain a priori constraint conditions such as symmetry, nonnegativity, invariance and momentum conservation. In particular, the diagonally lumped and consistent versions can be obtained as instances. Availability of free parameters, however, allows the mass matrix to be customized to special needs, such as high precision vibration frequencies or minimally dispersive wave propagation. An attractive feature of templates for FEM programming is that only one element implementation as module with free parameters is needed, and need not be recoded when the application problem class changes. The paper provides a general overview of the topic, and illustrates it with one-dimensional structural elements: bars and beams.},

They provide sufficient conditions for the stability of equilibria or more general invariant sets, as well as for their basin of attraction. The necessity, i.e. the existence of Lyapunov functions, has been studied in converse theorems, however, they do not provide a general method to compute them. Because of their importance in stability analysis, numerous computational construction methods have been developed within the Engineering, Informatics, and Mathematics community. They cover different types of systems such as ordinary differential equations, switched systems, non-smooth systems, discrete-time systems etc., and employ different methods such as series expansion, linear programming, linear matrix inequalities, collocation methods, algebraic methods, set-theoretic methods, and many others. This review brings these different methods together. First, the different types of systems, where Lyapunov functions are used, are briefly discussed. In the main part, the computational methods are presented, ordered by the type of method used to construct a Lyapunov function.},

The proposed iterative scheme only requires one inversion of Jacobian which is computationally very efficient if either LU-decomposition or GMRES-type methods are employed. The higher-order Frechet derivatives of the nonlinear system stemming from the considered ODEs are diagonal matrices. We used the higher-order Frechet derivatives to enhance the convergence-order of the iterative schemes proposed in this note and indeed the use of a multi-step method dramatically increases the convergence-order. The second-order Frechet derivative is used in the first step of an iterative technique which produced third-order convergence. In a second step we constructed matrix polynomial to enhance the convergence-order by three. Finally, we freeze the product of a matrix polynomial by the Jacobian inverse to generate the multi-step method. Each additional step will increase the convergence-order by three, with minimal computational effort. The convergence-order (CO) obeys the formula CO = 3m, where m is the number of steps per full-cycle of the considered iterative scheme. Few numerical experiments and conclusive remarks end the paper.

  abstract = {The reader can find in the literature a lot of different techniques to study the dynamics of a given system and also, many suitable numerical integrators to compute them. Notwithstanding the recent work of [Maffione et al., 2011b] for mappings, a detailed comparison among the widespread indicators of chaos in a general system is still lacking. Such a comparison could lead to select the most efficient algorithms given a certain dynamical problem. Furthermore, in order to choose the appropriate numerical integrators to compute them, more comparative studies among numerical integrators are also needed. This work deals with both problems. We first extend the work of [Maffione et al., 2011b] for mappings to the 2D [Henon \& Heiles, 1964] potential, and compare several variational indicators of chaos: the Lyapunov Indicator (LI); the Mean Exponential Growth Factor of Nearby Orbits (MEGNO); the Smaller Alignment Index (SALI) and its generalized version, the Generalized Alignment Index (GALI); the Fast Lyapunov Indicator (FLI) and its variant, the Orthogonal Fast Lyapunov Indicator (OFLI); the Spectral Distance (D) and the Dynamical Spectra of Stretching Numbers (SSNs). We also include in the record the Relative Lyapunov Indicator (RLI), which is not a variational indicator as the others. Then, we test a numerical technique to integrate Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) based on the Taylor method implemented by [Jorba \& Zou, 2005] (called taylor), and we compare its performance with other two well-known efficient integrators: the [Prince \& Dormand, 1981] implementation of a Runge-Kutta of order 7-8 (DOPRI8) and a Bulirsch-Stoer implementation. These tests are run under two very different systems from the complexity of their equations point of view: a triaxial galactic potential model and a perturbed 3D quartic oscillator. We first show that a combination of the FLI/OFLI, the MEGNO and the GALI(2N) succeeds in describing in detail most of the dynamical characteristics of a general Hamiltonian system. In the second part, we show that the precision of taylor is better than that of the other integrators tested, but it is not well suited to integrate systems of equations which include the variational ones, like in the computing of almost all the preceeding indicators of chaos. The result which induces us to draw this conclusion is that the computing times spent by taylor are far greater than the times consumed by the DOPRI8 and the Bulirsch-Stoer integrators in such cases. On the other hand, the package is very efficient when we only need to integrate the equations of motion (both in precision and speed), for instance to study the chaotic diffusion. We also notice that taylor attains a greater precision on the coordinates than either the DOPRI8 or the Bulirsch-Stoer.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces and studies the class of differential variational inequalities (DVIs) in a finite-dimensional Euclidean space. The DVI provides a powerful modeling paradigm for many applied problems in which dynamics, inequalities, and discontinuities are present; examples of such problems include constrained time-dependent physical systems with unilateral constraints, differential Nash games, and hybrid engineering systems with variable structures. The DVI unifies several mathematical problem classes that include ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with smooth and discontinuous right-hand sides, differential algebraic equations (DAEs), dynamic complementarity systems, and evolutionary variational inequalities. Conditions are presented under which the DVI can be converted, either locally or globally, to an equivalent ODE with a Lipschitz continuous right-hand function. For DVIs that cannot be so converted, we consider their numerical resolution via an Euler time-stepping procedure, which involves the solution of a sequence of finite-dimensional variational inequalities. Borrowing results from differential inclusions (DIs) with upper semicontinuous, closed and convex valued multifunctions, we establish the convergence of such a procedure for solving initial-value DVIs. We also present a class of DVIs for which the theory of DIs is not directly applicable, and yet similar convergence can be established. Finally, we extend the method to a boundary-value DVI and provide conditions for the convergence of the method. The results in this paper pertain exclusively to systems with ``index'' not exceeding two and which have absolutely continuous solutions.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT The standard formulation of Hamilton's principle requires the knowledge of the initial and end correct of a given dynamic system. Any attempt to use this principle for direct calculations without the variations of the initial and end coordinates vanishing brings incorrect results. It seems that this is the reason for the appearance in the scientific literature of arguments about the fitness of Hamilton's principle, and more generally Hamilton's law, for direct calculations of dynamic systems. However, it is shown in this paper that there exist six correct formulations of Hamilton's law for each degree of freedom of the dynamic system. These formulations also include Hamilton's principle. The use of all of the 6**n correct formulations yields correct results. The paper centers around 6**n correct formulations of Hamilton's law.},

Two basic coupling algorithms are discussed here, namely the explicit direct coupling approach and the implicit iterative coupling approach, which are formulated based on explicit/implicit time-marching techniques. Completely independent spatial and temporal discretizations among the interacting subdomains are permitted, allowing optimal discretization for each sub-domain of the model to be considered.

  abstract = {Green's function based methodologies for elastodynamics in both time and frequency domains, which can be either numerical or analytical, appear in many branches of physics and engineering. Thus, the development of exact expressions for Green's functions is of great importance. Unfortunately, such expressions are known only for relatively few kinds of geometry, medium and boundary conditions. In this way, due to the difficulty in finding exact Green's functions, specially in the time domain, the present paper presents a solution of the transient elastodynamic equations by a time-stepping technique based on the Explicit Green's Approach method written in terms of the Green's and Step response functions, both being computed numerically by the finite element method. The major feature is the computation of these functions separately by the central difference time integration scheme and locally owing to the principle of causality. More precisely, Green's functions are computed only at t = 螖t adopting two time substeps while Step response functions are computed directly without substeps. The proposed time-stepping method shows to be quite accurate with distinct numerical properties not presented in the standard central difference scheme as addressed in the numerical example.},

These Green's matrices are computed by the time discontinuous Galerkin finite element method only at the first time step. The system of coupled equations originated from the time discontinuous Galerkin method is then solved by an iterative predictor\textendash{}multicorrector algorithm. Once the Green's matrices are computed, no iterative process is required to obtain the displacement and the velocity vectors at any time level.

Therefore, the values obtained after an explicit computation cannot be used directly as initial conditions for an implicit simulation.

A comprehensive kinematical description using a corotational approach and an orthogonal tensor given by the exact polar decomposition is adopted. The state equation is written in terms of corotational variables according to the hypoelastic theory, relating the Jaumann derivative of the Cauchy stress to the Eulerian strain rate.The generalized- method (G) method and Generalized Energy-Momentum Method with an additional parameter (GEMM+) are employed in order to obtain a stable and controllable dissipative time-stepping scheme with algorithmic conservative properties for nonlinear dynamic analyses.The main contribution is to show that the energy-momentum conservation properties and numerical stability may be improved once a NURBS-based FEM in the spatial discretization is used. Also it is shown that high continuity can postpone the numerical instability when GEMM+ with consistent mass is employed; likewise, increasing the continuity class yields a decrease in the numerical dissipation. A parametric study is carried out in order to show the stability and energy budget in terms of several properties such as continuity class, spectral radius and lumped as well as consistent mass matrices.

We assume that the input x belongs to a class C of signals generated by a linear dynamical system, characterized by an m\textsuperscript{th} order linear differential operator L(D), D = d/dt, driven by inputs of bounded energy.

This subject helps to obtain an explicit algorithm, which does not involve solving simultaneous system of equations in each time increment, even linear one. Moreover, the number of corrections, which is the main concern in the explicit-implicit algorithms, is selected automatically in the suggested procedure. Afterwards, some numerical examples are solved to illustrate the validity and the robustness of the proposed algorithm. Results show that applying the proposed framework to the higher order explicit-implicit integrations exhibits excellent accuracy in comparison with the well-known implicit Newmark-beta and Wilson-theta schemes.

The motion of the droplet is coupled with the motion of the component or chip to be assembled and involves dynamic contact lines. A methodology based on a Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) discretization has been developed for the dynamic analysis of the droplet motion. A surface energy based formulation has been developed to incorporate the surface tension effects. The developed methodology leads to an updated Lagrangian scheme with a Galerkin in space and Least square in time formulation. The Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) representation used for the spatial discretization enables the method to handle problems involving complex droplet geometries. The ability of the NURBS representation to provide both global and local control, along with the least square method used in this methodology, enables us to develop an unconditionally stable time integration scheme which can be optimized to achieve desired accuracy and numerical dissipation efficiently. A sample problem of droplet shape evolution has been solved to demonstrate the path prediction capability of the proposed methodology. In future, the method can be applied to solve various real world dynamic motion problems associated with droplets.},

  abstract = {An analysis of thin-wire antennas and scatterers using quadratic spline-based expansion and weighting functions within the Method of Moments (MoM) is presented. So-called quadratic B-Splines are introduced as a generalisation of the well-known rectangular and triangle expansion functions. The thin-wire version of the electric-field integral equation (EFIE) is solved by the Method of Moments (MoM) using Galerkin's method. The described procedure results in a symmetrical structure of the impedance matrix, which allows the application of symmetric solvers with the benefit of a very effective solving procedure. Due to the choice of the expansion and weighting functions the results are very precise for near-fields and points near the structure. It become possible to investigate structures with very small separations between the wires. Numerical examples demonstrate the suitability of the method for the EMC-analysis and show the advantages of a reduced solving time in the analysis of large systems and a lower limit for the shortest separation between two wires.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this research has been to develop and evaluate procedures for the mathematical modeling of hull forms. This has been accomplished through the application and integration of high-level computer graphics technology into the design process. High-level computer graphics are characterized by the ability to manipulate a realistically rendered image of a three-dimensional object, with a colored and shaded surface, in real time. The hull forms studied are appropriate to hard chine and round bilge small craft. The first interactive graphics program has been developed for the definition of developable hull surfaces such as the hard chine hull. Control curves, including the keel chine and sheer lines, are faired interactively through real-time graphical techniques on the workstation using the Curve Fairing Tool (CFT) program. A developable surface is then generated between the control curves using the Developable surface Definition Tool (DSDT). B-spline mathematical techniques have been found to be particularly useful for defining complex three-dimensional sculpted surfaces, such as the round bilge hull. A second interactive graphics program, SPLINE, has been developed which facilitates the interactive definition of the B-spline control graph and real-time manipulation of the model image. Finally, a technique has been developed for in situ measurements of an existing hull form which might serve for example, as a 'parent' for further development using either DSDT or SPLINE. The procedure is based on the use of laser light striping techniques to illuminate surface contours, in conjunction with video image recording. A processing procedure then applies inverse homogeneous coordinate transformations to obtain the planar contour coordinates which are used to define the surface geometry. This research is being conducted at the Computer-Aided Design Technology (CADTECH) research laboratory in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Washington.},

In the case of an FIR (finite-impulse-response) digital filter, it has been found that a B-spline representation of the filter response leads to minimal time and circuit complexities. The number of filter coefficients required in this implementation is reduced and corresponds to the lower sampling rate of the filter function. The aliasing usually associated with this lower sampling rate is substantially reduced by processing the input data with a prefilter which can be interpreted as an interpolator. The prefilter is implemented using a cascade of running average filters which requires no multipliers. The B-spline approach is suited to VLSI implementation and leads to substantial reductions in circuit complexity.},

In this procedure, no velocity parameters are used, so the selection of a suitable velocity background model is not necessary in the area with complex geological bodies. Another characteristic of this method is the ability to solve the discordance between travel time data and elevation data which always occurs while using conventional interpretation method and ensure the depths of geological surfaces transformed from seismic data full coinciding with those from original drilling data. \&copy; 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

  issn = {10871357},
  abstract = {This paper presents a parameterization and an interpolation method for quintic splines, which result in a smooth and consistent feed rate profile. The discrepancy between the spline parameter and the actual arc length leads to undesirable feed fluctuations and discontinuity, which elicit themselves as high frequency acceleration and jerk harmonics, causing unwanted structural vibrations and excessive tracking error. Two different approaches are presented that alleviate this problem. The first approach is based on modifying the spline tool path so that it is optimally parameterized with respect to its arc length, which allows it to be accurately interpolated in real-time with minimal complexity. The second approach is based on scheduling the spline parameter to accurately yield the desired arc displacement (hence feed rate), either by approximation of the relationship between the arc length and the spline parameter with a feed correction polynomial, or by solving the spline parameter iteratively in real-time at each interpolation step. This approach is particularly suited for predetermined spline tool paths, which are not arc-length parameterized and cannot be modified. The proposed methods have been compared to approximately arc-length C\textsuperscript{3} quintic spline parameterization (Wang, F.-C., Wright, P. K., Barsky, B. A., and Yang, D. C.

The reason for developing the method lies in its application to two-way interacting nested models of the atmosphere. When compared with the gridpoint representation, the cubic-spline representation allows direct evaluation of derivatives in the model equations, and leads to a substantial reduction of shortwave dispersion of advecting and propagating waves. When compared with the Fourier spectral representation, the cubic B-splines as basis functions provide simple but exact means of implementing a variety of boundary conditions that are needed at the domain interfaces, as well as at natural boundaries. A sharp (sixth order) low-pass filter, which is built into the cubic-spline transform, effectively eliminates adverse nonlinear accumulation of small-scale errors near the resolution limit. These features, critically important to noise-free nesting, are defined and analyzed in this paper in the simpler context of a single ID domain. The actual procedures for two-way interactive nesting will be presented in a subsequent paper.},

This paper describes a hybrid current controller for the linear compressors. It comprises a conventional proportional-integral (PI) controller, and a B-spline neural network compensator which is trained on-line and in real-time in order to minimize the current tracking error under all conditions with uncertain disturbances. It has been shown that the hybrid current controller has a superior steady-state and transient performance over the conventional carrier based PI controller. The performance of the proposed hybrid controller has been demonstrated by extensive simulations and experiments. It has also been shown that the linear compressor operates stably under the current feedback control and the piston stroke can be adjusted by varying the amplitude of the current command. \&copy; 2007 IEEE.},

The creation of complex NURBS in design environments is a tedious process because very few tools exist, that allow a designer to design intuitively in real-time. Standard input devices such as the mouse and the keyboard do not provide the designer with direct and easy capabilities for surface manipulation. We have developed a NURBS modeling system that allows the designer to edit NURBS surfaces in realtime using a pressure sensitive sculpting/molding input device designed to be worn as a glove called the ModelGlove. This input device is equipped with force and position sensors for quantifying touch and intent of the designer. A virtual block deforms in a physically realistic manner in response to the user's direct manipulation of a hard or soft real physical object. The dynamic behavior of the NURBS model in response to the force and position input obtained from the ModelGlove, produces highly natural shape variations.

The control aims at making the statistical information of the output pdfs to follow those of a target pdf. For such a control framework, a variable structure adaptive tracking control strategy is first established using two-step neural network models. Following the B-spline neural network approximation to the integrated performance function, the concerned problem is transferred into the tracking of given weights. The dynamic neural network (DNN) is employed to identify the unknown nonlinear dynamics between the control input and the weights related to the integrated function. To achieve the required control objective, an adaptive controller based on the proposed DNN is developed so as to track a reference trajectory. Stability analysis for both the identification and tracking errors is developed via the use of Lyapunov stability criterion.

  copyright = {Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.},
  issn = {1569190X},
  abstract = {In fluid power system simulation, orifice flow is, in the main, clearly in the turbulent area. Only when a valve is closed or an actuator driven against an end stopper does the flow become laminar as pressure drop over the orifice approaches zero. So, in terms of accuracy, the description of laminar flow is hardly necessary. Unfortunately, when a purely turbulent description of the orifice is used, numerical problems occur when pressure drop becomes close to zero since the first derivative of flow with respect of pressure drop approaches infinity when pressure drop approaches zero. Furthermore, the second derivative becomes discontinuous, which causes numerical noise and an infinitely small integration step when a variable step integrator is used. In this paper, a numerically efficient model for the orifice flow is proposed using a cubic spline function to describe the flow in the laminar and transition areas. Parameters for the cubic spline are selected such that its first derivative is equal to the first derivative of the pure turbulent orifice flow model in the boundary condition. The key advantage of this model comes from the fact that no geometrical data is needed in calculation of flow from the pressure drop. In real-time simulation of fluid power circuits, a trade-off exists between accuracy and calculation speed. This investigation is made for the two-regime flow orifice model. The effect of selection of transition pressure drop and integration time step on the accuracy and speed of solution is investigated. \&copy; 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

We examine the problems that led to the introduction of B-series and survey a number of more recent developments, including applications outside numerical mathematics. Word series (series of functions parameterized by words from an alphabet) provide in some cases a very convenient alternative to B-series. Associated with word series is a group G of coefficients with a composition rule simpler than the corresponding rule in the Butcher group. From a more mathematical point of view, integrators, like Runge-Kutta schemes, that are affine equivariant are represented by elements of the Butcher group, integrators that are equivariant with respect to arbitrary changes of variables are represented by elements of the word group G.},

  abstract = {Butcher series appear when Runge-Kutta methods for ordinary differential equations are expanded in power series of the step size parameter. Each term in a Butcher series consists of a weighted elementary differential, and the set of all such differentials is isomorphic to the set of rooted trees, as noted by Cayley in the mid 19th century. A century later Butcher discovered that rooted trees can also be used to obtain the order conditions of Runge-Kutta methods, and he found a natural group structure, today known as the Butcher group. It is now known that many numerical methods also can be expanded in Butcher series; these are called B-series methods. A long-standing problem has been to characterize, in terms of qualitative features, all B-series methods. Here we tell the story of Butcher series, stretching from the early work of Cayley, to modern developments and connections to abstract algebra, and finally to the resolution of the characterization problem. This resolution introduces geometric tools and perspectives to an area traditionally explored using analysis and combinatorics.},

By interpreting the elementary weight function as a mapping from input values to output values and introducing some special mappings, we are able to derive the order conditions of several types of integration methods in a straight-forward way. The simplicity of the derivation is illustrated by linear multistep methods that use the second derivative as an input value, Runge-Kutta type methods that use the second as well as first derivatives, and general two-step Runge-Kutta methods. We derive new high stage-order methods in each example. In particular, we found a symmetric and stiffly-accurate method of order eight in the second example.},

The subject of the present paper is a new recursive formulation of the composition rules. This both simplifies and extends the existing approaches. Instead of using the order conditions based on trees, we propose the construction of the order conditions using a suitably chosen basis on the tree space. In particular, the linear structure of the tree space gives a representation of the C and D simplifying assumptions on trees which is not restricted to Runge-Kutta methods. A proof of the group structure of the set of elementary weight functions satisfying the D simplifying assumptions is also given is this paper.},

We do not attempt to realize the series as (generalized) Runge-Kutta methods, so we are not forced to restrict ourselves to the finite dimensional case. The theory extends to the multiderivative case as well, and the formulas remain valid for series which are not realizable as Runge-Kutta methods at all. Finally we extend the multi-value methods of J. Butcher [2] to the multiderivative case, which leads to a big class of integration methods for ordinary differential equations, including the methods of Nordsieck and Gear [3].

These formulae, namely Diagonally Extended Singly Implicit formulae (DESI), have been investigated by the present author and have been implemented in an experimental code in a variable-stepsize/variable-order mode. Numerical experimentation on a large number of stiff systems has shown that the DESI code is much more efficient than STRIDE (which is an implementation of SIRK formulae) and competitive with BDF implementations. In this paper we investigate the efficiency of the DESI code on large dimension stiff systems with banded Jacobians, which arise from the discretization of PDEs with the Numerical Method of Lines (NUMOL). The results obtained by the DESI code are compared with the results obtained by the widely used BDF code LSODE. These results indicate that the current implementation of DESI performs satisfactorily and, in particular, is competitive with LSODE.},

  issn = {0168-9274},
  doi = {10/fpx8bn},
  abstract = {Many orbit problems in celestial mechanics are described by (nonstiff) initial-value problems (IVPs) for second-order ordinary differential equations of the form y${'}{'}$=f(y). The most successful integration methods are based on high-order Runge\textendash{}Kutta\textendash{}Nystr{\"o}m formulas. However, these methods were designed for sequential computer systems. In this paper, we consider high-order parallel methods that are not based on Runge\textendash{}Kutta\textendash{}Nystr{\"o}m formulas, but which fit into the class of general linear methods. In each step, these methods compute blocks of k approximate solution values (or stage values) at k different points using the whole previous block of solution values. The k stage values can be computed in parallel, so that on a k-processor computer system such methods effectively perform as a one-value method. The block methods considered in this paper are such that each equation defining a stage value resembles a linear multistep equation of the familiar St{\"o}rmer\textendash{}Cowell type. For k=4 and k=5 we constructed explicit \{PSC\} methods with stage order q=k and step point order p=k+1 and implicit \{PSC\} methods with q=k+1 and p=k+2. For k$\geq$6 we can construct explicit \{PSC\} methods with q=k and p=k+2 and implicit \{PSC\} methods with q=k+1 and p=k+3. It turns out that for k$\geq$5 the abscissae of the stage values can be chosen such that only k-1 stage values in each block have to be computed, so that the number of computational stages, and hence the number of processors and the number of starting values needed, reduces to k${_\ast}$=k-1. The numerical examples reported in this paper show that the effective number of right-hand side evaluations required by a variable stepsize implementation of the 10th-order \{PSC\} method is 4 up to 30 times less than required by the Runge\textendash{}Kutta\textendash{}Nystr{\"o}m code \{DOPRIN\} (which is considered as one of the most efficient sequential codes for second-order ODEs). Furthermore, a comparison with the 12th-order parallel code \{PIRKN\} reveals that the \{PSC\} code is, in spite of its lower order, at least equally efficient, and in most cases more efficient than PIRKN.},

Since the kernel is singular or nearly singular, two main difficulties arise after the domain decomposition: how to properly account for the history/memory part and how to perform the integration accurately. To address these issues, we propose a novel hybrid approach for the numerical integration based on the combination of three-term-recurrence relations of Jacobi polynomials and high-order Gauss quadrature. The different approximations used in the hybrid approach are justified theoretically and through numerical examples. Based on this, we propose a new multi-domain spectral method for high-order accurate time integrations and study its stability properties by identifying the method as a generalized linear method. Numerical experiments confirm hp-convergence for both time-fractional differential equations and time-fractional partial differential equations.},

Our investigation is addressed to providing the building blocks useful to analyze the linear stability properties of \{GLMs\} for second order ODEs: thus, we present the extension of the classical notions of stability matrix, stability polynomial, stability and periodicity interval, A -stability and P -stability to the family of GLMs. Special attention will be given to the derivation of highly stable GLMs, whose stability properties depend on the stability polynomial of indirect Runge\textendash{}Kutta\textendash{}Nystr{\"o}m methods based on Gauss\textendash{}Legendre collocation points, which are known to be P -stable. In this way, we are able to provide P -stable \{GLMs\} whose order of convergence is greater than that of the corresponding \{RKN\} method, without heightening the computational cost. We finally provide and discuss examples of P -stable irreducible \{GLMs\} satisfying the mentioned features.},

To this end, more universal integration methods are considered in this paper: The so-called general linear methods which cover in particular linear multistep methods and Runge-Kutta methods. In order to establish a new theory for these integration methods, a network theoretical approach is used. A new class of Runge-Kutta methods will be derived. The generated algorithmic models inhere the same good properties as wave digital models but their numerical accuracy is increased.

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to analyze the relationships between four personality traits (calmness, trainability, dog sociability and boldness) of dogs (Canis familiaris) and dog and owner demographics on a large sample size with 14,004 individuals. German speaking dog owners could characterize their dog by filling out a form on the Internet. There were five demographic variables for dogs and nine for owners. Two statistical methods were used for investigating the associations between personality and demographic traits: the more traditional general linear methods and regression trees that are ideal for analyzing non-linear relationships in the structure of the data. The results showed that calmness is influenced primarily by the dog's age, the neutered status, the number of different types of professional training courses (e.g. obedience, agility) the dog had experienced and the age of acquisition. The least calm dogs were less than 2.5 years old, neutered and acquired after the first 12 weeks of age, while the calmest dogs were older than 6.9 years. Trainability was affected primarily by the training experiences, the dog's age, and the purpose of keeping the dog. The least trainable dogs had not received professional training at all and were older than 3 years. The most trainable dogs were those who participated in three or more types of professional training. Sociability toward conspecifics was mainly determined by the age, sex, training experience and time spent together. The least sociable dogs were older than 4.8 years and the owners spent less than 3 h with the dog daily. The most sociable dogs were less than 1.5 years old. Males were less sociable toward their conspecifics than females. Boldness was affected by the sex and age of the dog and the age of acquisition. The least bold were females acquired after the age of 1 year or bred by the owner. The boldest dogs were males, acquired before the age of 12 weeks, and were younger than 2 years old. Other variables, including the owner's gender, age, education, previous experience with dogs, the number of people and dogs in the household, and purpose of keeping the dogs had minor, but detectable effects. The results suggest that on-line questionnaires are a very effective means for collecting data about dog behavior, especially if owners are motivated by instant feedback. However, note that the characteristics of dogs in the present study were reported by the owners, and the associations with the traits do not necessarily represent a causal relationship.},

In particular, they have stability properties as for Runge-Kutta methods and it is easy to start the methods and to change stepsize. Because of the high stage order, continuous output is easier to achieve than for Runge-Kutta methods and this gives them a potential for the solution of delay problems as well as for ordinary differential equations. These new methods will be known as ``ARK'' or ``Almost Runge-Kutta'' methods. Even though they exist for orders at least as high as 6, we will concentrate here on methods of order 4, for which we present four sample methods. For one of these methods, we will present some numerical results for some initial value ordinary differential equation problems and some delay differential equations, illustrating various features of the new methods.},

The investigations are concentrated on the construction of a fine ILU-GMRES preconditioner for solving efficiently not only the well-conditioned coefficient matrices but specially the ill-ones. It is shown that, if the image matrix (preconditioner origin) is firstly preprocessed (scaled, normalized and reordered), a high quality ILU preconditioner is achieved. Numerical experiments considering different test-systems and different operation conditions illustrate how tricky can be the simulation of power system dynamics if the Jacobian matrix (coefficient matrix) is ill-conditioned, normally associated to an adverse operation condition. It is shown that a traditional implicit integration method may fail in this case, whereas the combination BDF-GMRES presents an outstanding performance. \&copy; 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper considers three ways of transformer iron-core modeling relevant for ferroresonance simulations that are presented in detail. The presented transformer models are suitable for the state-space form of differential equation systems that describe the ferroresonance effect. Before solving the obtained differential equation systems, their numerical eigenvalues were analyzed in detail. This eigenvalue analysis has revealed a very stiff nature of the obtained equation systems. The obtained equation systems are solved by using a A-and L-stable numerical differentiation formulas (NDF) numerical technique, with the aim of suppressing undesired numerical oscillations. The obtained numerical results are verified by comparison against the available experimental results. The presented analysis shows that the suggested transformer model based on a hysteretic core inductor provides the most accurate results in terms of voltage and current waveforms and their peak values during the steady-state and transient ferroresonance. The analyzed transformer core models can be implemented in the existing Electromagnetic Transients Program-type simulation tools by using a combination of the trapezoidal and proposed NDF2 method. \&copy; 1986-2012 IEEE.},

  abstract = {We present an adaptive algorithm for time integration of fluid-structure integration problems. The method relies on a fully coupled procedure to solve FSI problems in which a naturally GCL-compliant ALE formulation for the finite-element spatial discretization is used. The main originality of the proposed solution procedure is that time integration is performed using automatic order and stepsize selections (hp-adaptivity) based on the Backward Differentiation Formulas (BDF). The stepsize selection is based on a local error estimate, an error controller and a step rejection mechanism. It guarantees that the solution precision is within the user targeted tolerance. The order selection is based on a stability test and a quarantine mechanism. The selection is performed to ensure that no other methods within the family of 0-stable BDF methods would produce a solution of the targeted precision for a larger stepsize (and thus a lower computational time). To improve efficiency, the time integration procedure also relies on a modified Newton method and a predictor. The time adaptive algorithm behaviors and performances are assessed on the vortex-induced translational and rotational vibrations of a square cylinder and on the wake-induced vibrations of 3 cylinders in an in-line arrangement. The algorithm yields substantial CPU time savings (compared to constant stepsize and order integration) while delivering solutions of prescribed accuracies. \&copy; 2015 Elsevier B.V..},

  abstract = {This paper presents a procedure based on the Backward Differentiation Formulas to obtain efficient time integration of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The adaptive algorithm performs both stepsize and order selection to control respectively the solution accuracy and the computational efficiency of the time integration process. The stepsize selection (h-adaptivity) is based on a local error estimate and an error controller to guarantee that the numerical solution accuracy is within a user prescribed tolerance. The order selection (p-adaptivity) relies on the idea that low-accuracy solutions can be computed efficiently by low order time integrators while highly accurate solutions require high order time integrators to keep computational time low. Hence, the algorithm selects the most appropriate method within the formulas of order 1 to 5 based on the prescribed solution accuracy and equation stiffness. Doing so it guarantees that the variable stepsize BDF methods used always are stable during the whole time integration interval. The adaptive algorithm behaviors and performances are illustrated on the flow over a circular cylinder at low Reynolds numbers.},

  abstract = {An iterative method is needed when implicit integration method is used to integrate the independent coordinates of differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) which come from multibody system dynamics. If the iterative method is Newton's method, numerical differentiation is needed to obtain the Jacobian matrix. A fixed-point iterative method without the using of the Jacobian matrix can simplify the progress. The nonlinear algebraic constraint equations in DAEs are also solved by iteration to obtain the dependent coordinates. A two-loop structure is designed to manage those two iterations. The numerical accuracy of the integration method influences the numbers of iteration of implicit integration method which is called as the outer loop. Backward differential formulation (BDF) is introduced as the integration method into the two-loop method. New strategy is proposed to constitute the new two-loop method. The numbers of iteration of outer loop in the new two-loop method are reduced, and the computational efficiency is improved. The new two-loop method can solve the DAEs of multibody system dynamics well, and its universality is good. Numerical examples are provided. \&copy; 2016 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.},

  abstract = {The companion paper "Higher-order in time quasi-unconditionally stable ADI solvers for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations in 2D and 3D curvilinear domains," which is referred to as Part I in what follows, introduces ADI (alternating direction implicit) solvers of higher orders of temporal accuracy (orders s = 2 to 6) for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations in two- and three- dimensional space. The proposed methodology employs the backward differentiation formulae (BDF) together with a quasilinear-like formulation, high-order extrapolation for nonlinear components, and the Douglas-Gunn splitting. A variety of numerical results presented in Part I demonstrate in practice the theoretical convergence rates enjoyed by these algorithms, as well as their excellent accuracy and stability properties for a wide range of Reynolds numbers. In particular, the proposed schemes enjoy a certain property of "quasi-unconditional stability": For small enough (problem- dependent) fixed values of the time step \&Delta;t, these algorithms are stable for arbitrarily fine spatial discretizations. The present contribution presents a mathematical basis for the observed performance of these algorithms. Short of providing stability theorems for the full Navier-Stokes BDF-ADI solvers, this paper puts forth a number of stability proofs for BDF-ADI schemes as well as some related unsplit BDF schemes for a variety of related linear model problems in one, two, and three spatial dimensions. These include proofs of quasi-unconditional stability for unsplit BDF schemes of orders 2 \&le; s \&le; 6, and even a proof of a form of unconditional stability for two-dimensional BDF-ADI schemes of order 2 for both convection and diffusion problems. Additionally, a set of numerical tests presented in this paper for the compressible Navier-Stokes equation indicate that quasi-unconditional stability carries over to the fully nonlinear context. \&copy; by SIAM 2017.},

  abstract = {The infrarenal abdominal aorta is particularly prone to atherosclerotic plaque formation while the thoracic aorta is relatively resistant. Localized differences in hemodynamic conditions, including differences in velocity profiles, wall shear stress, and recirculation zones have been implicated in the differential localization of disease in the infrarenal aorta. A comprehensive computational framework was developed, utilizing a stabilized, time accurate, finite element method, to solve the equations governing blood flow in a model of a normal human abdominal aorta under simulated rest, pulsatile, flow conditions. Flow patterns and wall shear stress were computed. A recirculation zone was observed to form along the posterior wall of the infrarenal aorta. Low time-averaged wall shear stress and high shear stress temporal oscillations, as measured by an oscillatory shear index, were present in this location, along the posterior wall opposite the superior mesenteric artery and along the anterior wall between the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries. These regions were noted to coincide with a high probability-of-occurrence of sudanophilic lesions as reported by Cornhill et al. (Monogr. Atheroscler. 15:13-19, 1990). This numerical investigation provides detailed quantitative data on hemodynamic conditions in the abdominal aorta heretofore lacking in the study of the localization of atherosclerotic disease.

We introduce a phase-field approximation to the Lagrangian for discrete fracture problems and derive the coupled system of equations that govern the motion of the body and evolution of the phase-field. We study the behavior of the model in one dimension and show how it influences material properties. For the temporal discretization of the equations of motion, we present both a monolithic and staggered time integration scheme. We study the behavior of the dynamic model by performing a number of two and three dimensional numerical experiments. We also introduce a local adaptive refinement strategy and study its performance in the context of locally refined T-splines. We show that the combination of the phase-field model and local adaptive refinement provides an effective method for simulating fracture in three dimensions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Then, luminal surfaces are extracted by isocontouring the preprocessed data, followed by the extraction of vascular skeleton via Voronoi and Delaunay diagrams. Next, the skeleton-based sweeping method is used to construct hexahedral control meshes. Templates are designed for various branching configurations to decompose the geometry into mapped meshable patches. Each patch is then meshed using one-to-one sweeping techniques, and boundary vertices are projected to the luminal surface. Finally, hexahedral solid NURBS are constructed and used in isogeometric analysis of blood flow. Piecewise linear hexahedral meshes can also be obtained using this approach.

The half-point rule is independent of the polynomial order of the basis. Efficient rules require taking into account the precise smoothness of basis functions across element boundaries. Several rules of practical interest are obtained, and a numerical procedure for determining efficient rules is presented.

Finite element solutions are not common because primal variational formulations of fourth-order operators are only well defined and integrable if the finite element basis functions are piecewise smooth and globally C-1-continuous. There are a very limited number of two-dimensional finite elements possessing C-1-continuity applicable to complex geometries but none in three-dimensions. We propose isogeometric analysis as a technology that possesses a unique combination of attributes for complex problems involving higher-order differential operators, namely, higher-order accuracy, robustness, two- and three-dimensional geometric flexibility, compact support, and, most importantly, the possibility of C-1 and higher-order continuity. A NURBS-based variational formulation for the Cahn-Hilliard equation was tested on two- and three-dimensional problems. We present steady state solutions in two-dimensions and, for the first time, in three-dimensions. To achieve these results an adaptive time-stepping method is introduced. We also present a technique for desensitizing calculations to dependence on mesh refinement. This enables the calculation of topologically correct solutions on coarse meshes, opening the way to practical engineering applications of phase-field methodology. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

  doi = {10/c2n64f},
  abstract = {A new finite element method for fourth-order elliptic partial differential equations is presented and applied to thin bending theory problems in structural mechanics and to a strain gradient theory problem. The method combines concepts from the continuous Galerkin (CG) method, the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method and stabilization techniques. A brief review of the CG method, the DG method and stabilization techniques highlights the advantages and disadvantages of these methods and suggests a new approach for the solution of fourth-order elliptic problems. A continuous/discontinuous Galerkin (C/DG) method is proposed which uses C-0-continuous interpolation functions and is formulated in the primary variable only. The advantage of this formulation over a more traditional mixed approach is that the introduction of additional unknowns and related difficulties can be avoided. In the context of thin bending theory, the C/DG method leads to a formulation where displacements are the only degrees of freedom, and no rotational degrees of freedom need to be considered. The main feature of the C/DG method is the weak enforcement of continuity of first and higher-order derivatives through stabilizing terms on interior boundaries. Consistency, stability and convergence of the method are shown analytically. Numerical experiments verify the theoretical results, and applications are presented for Bernoulli-Euler beam bending, Poisson-Kirchhoff plate bending and a shear layer problem using Toupin-Mindlin strain gradient theory.

  volume = {195},

  doi = {10/fgj4xt},
  abstract = {Blood velocity and pressure fields in large arteries are greatly influenced by the deformability of the vessel. Moreover, wave propagation phenomena in the cardiovascular system can only be described considering wall deformability since blood is usually described as an incompressible fluid. However, computational methods for simulating blood flow in three-dimensional models of arteries have either considered a rigid wall assumption for the vessel or significantly simplified or reduced geometries. Computing blood flow in deformable domains using standard techniques like the ALE method remains a formidable problem for large, realistic anatomic and physiologic models of the cardiovascular system. We have developed a new method to simulate blood flow in three-dimensional deformable models of arteries. The method couples the equations of the deformation of the vessel wall at the variational level as a boundary condition for the fluid domain. We consider a strong coupling of the degrees-of-freedom of the fluid and the solid domains, and a linear membrane model (enhanced with transverse shear) for the vessel wall. The effect of the vessel wall boundary is therefore added in a monolithic way to the fluid equations, resulting in a remarkably robust scheme. We present here the mathematical formulation of the method and discuss issues related to the fluid-solid coupling, membrane formulation, time integration method, and boundary and initial conditions. Implementation is discussed and results with simple geometries as well as large subject-specific models are presented. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  doi = {10/cq72c8},
  abstract = {We begin the mathematical study of Isogeometric Analysis based on NURBS (non-uniform rational B-splines). Isogeometric Analysis is a generalization of classical Finite Element Analysis (FEA) which possesses improved properties. For example, NURBS are capable of more precise geometric representation of complex objects and, in particular, can exactly represent many commonly engineered shapes, such as cylinders, spheres and tori. Isogeometric Analysis also simplifies mesh refinement because the geometry is fixed at the coarsest level of refinement and is unchanged throughout the refinement process. This eliminates geometrical errors and the necessity of linking the refinement procedure to a CAD representation of the geometry, as in classical FEA. In this work we study approximation and stability properties in the context of h-refinement. We develop approximation estimates based on a new Bramble-Hilbert lemma in so-called ``bent'' Sobolev spaces appropriate for NURBS approximations and establish inverse estimates similar to those for finite elements. We apply the theoretical results to several cases of interest including elasticity, isotropic incompressible elasticity and Stokes flow, and advection-diffusion, and perform numerical tests which corroborate the mathematical results. We also perform numerical calculations that involve hypotheses outside our theory and these suggest that there are many other interesting mathematical properties of Isogeometric Analysis yet to be proved.},

We conclude that the potential for the k-method is high, but smoothness is an issue that is not well understood due to the historical dominance of C-0-continuous finite elements and therefore further studies are warranted.

After reviewing some fundamentals of isogeometric analysis, application is made to several structural models, including rods, thin beams, membranes, and thin plates. Rotationless beam and plate models are utilized as well as three-dimensional solid models. The concept of k-refinement is explored and shown to produce more accurate and robust results than corresponding finite elements. Through the use of nonlinear parameterization, ``optical'' branches of frequency spectra are eliminated for k-refined meshes. Optical branches have been identified as contributors to Gibbs phenomena in wave propagation problems and the cause of rapid degradation of higher modes in p-method finite elements. A geometrically exact model of the NASA Aluminum Testbed Cylinder is constructed and frequencies and mode shapes are computed and shown to compare favorably with experimental results.

For purposes of analysis, the basis is refined and/or its order elevated without changing the geometry or its parameterization. Analogues of finite element h- and p-refinement schemes are presented and a new, more efficient, higher-order concept, k-refinement, is introduced. Refinements are easily implemented and exact geometry is maintained at all levels without the necessity of subsequent communication with a CAD (Computer Aided Design) description. In the context of structural mechanics, it is established that the basis functions are complete with respect to affine transformations, meaning that all rigid body motions and constant strain states are exactly represented. Standard patch tests are likewise satisfied. Numerical examples exhibit optimal rates of convergence for linear elasticity problems and convergence to thin elastic shell solutions. A k-refinement strategy is shown to converge toward monotone solutions for advection-diffusion processes with sharp internal and boundary layers, a very surprising result. It is argued that isogeometric analysis is a viable alternative to standard, polynomial-based, finite element analysis and possesses several advantages. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

This paper develops a new computational formulation that combines the advantages of discontinuous Galerkin methods with the data structure of their continuous Galerkin counterparts. The new method uses local, element-wise problems to project a continuous finite element space into a given discontinuous space, and then applies a discontinuous Galerkin formulation. The projection leads to parameterization of the discontinuous degrees-of-freedom by their continuous counterparts and has a variational multiscale interpretation. This significantly reduces the computational burden and, at the same time, little or no degradation of the solution occurs. In fact, the new method produces improved solutions compared with the traditional discontinuous Galerkin method in some situations. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  issn = {0045-7825},
  doi = {10/bk7hxc},
  abstract = {In three-dimensional blood flow simulations of the cardiovascular system, velocity and pressure fields in the computational domain are highly affected by outlet boundary conditions. This fact has motivated the development of novel methods to couple three-dimensional computational domains with one-dimensional numerical models or, alternatively, with zero-dimensional or one-dimensional analytic models. In all such methods described to date, whether they are explicit or implicit, the relationship between flow and pressure at the outlet boundary is enforced weakly. This coupling does not include any constraints on the shape of the velocity profiles nor on the distribution of pressure at the interface. As a result, there remain some classes of problems that are, at best, difficult to solve, and at worst, intractable, with current numerical methods for simulating blood flow. These include problems with significant flow reversal during part of the cardiac cycle or geometric complexity in the proximity of the outlet of the computational domain. We have implemented a novel method to resolve these challenging problems whereby an augmented Lagrangian method is used to enforce constraints on the shape of the velocity profile at the interface between the upstream computational domain and the downstream analytic domain. These constraints on the shape of the velocity profile are added to the Coupled Multidomain Method in order to implicitly couple the computational domain with downstream analytic models. In this study, an axi-symmetric profile is imposed after ensuring that each constrained outlet boundary is circular. We demonstrate herein that including constraints on the shape of the velocity profile does not affect velocity and pressure fields except in the immediate vicinity of the constrained outlet boundaries. Furthermore, this new method enables the solution of problems which diverged with an unconstrained method. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

The Galerkin method requires relatively fine meshes to retain an acceptable degree of accuracy for wide ranges of values of the physical coefficients. Numerous criteria for improved accuracy via Galerkin/least-squares are proposed and examined in the entire parameter space. Of these, several provide the lowest error in nodal amplification factors, each in a certain range of ratios of physical coefficients. Guidelines for required mesh resolutions are presented for Galerkin and Galerkin/least-squares, showing that in large parts of the parameter space substantial savings may be obtained by employing Galerkin/least-squares. Galerkin/least-squares/gradient least-squares, a new variation of the Galerkin method, is designed to provide exact nodal amplification factors, offering accurate solutions at any resolution.

  volume = {159},

  doi = {10/fdhwpp},
  abstract = {This work approaches strain localization by recognizing the multiple scales inherent in the problem. A component associated with the region of localized strain (typically, one with high gradient) is referred to as the fine scale. It represents the microstructure. The field obtained by removing the fine scale from the total solution is referred to as the coarse scale. The aim of the multiple scale method advanced here is to derive a model for the coarse scale field that accounts for the finite scale. This process eliminates the fine scale from the problem, yet retains its effect. In applying this framework to the nonlinear problems with which localized strains are associated, a crucial step is a first-order approximation of the relevant relations. The fully nonlinear problem is solved by an iterative scheme. By accounting directly for the microstructure the multiple scale model recovers the regularizing effects of various alternative formulations for softening strain localization. It thus presents itself as a unifying framework for such models. Numerical solutions are shown to be invariant with respect to the discretization. Furthermore, for cases in which the displacements assume a distinct profile within the localization band, the multiple scale model provides a resolution that can be made as accurate as desired even with the coarsest mesh possible. The model is applied to strain localization problems that arise in inviscid and viscoplastic solids. Numerical simulations are presented that demonstrate the efficacy of the approach.

  abstract = {This paper describes an automatic and efficient approach to construct unstructured tetrahedral and hexahedral meshes for a composite domain made up of heterogeneous materials. The boundaries of these material regions form non-manifold surfaces. In earlier papers, we developed an octree-based isocontouring method to construct unstructured 3D meshes for a single material (homogeneous) domain with manifold boundary. In this paper, we introduce the notion of a material change edge and use it to identify the interface between two or several different materials. A novel method to calculate the minimizer point for a cell shared by more than two materials is provided, which forms a non-manifold node on the boundary. We then mesh all the material regions simultaneously and automatically while conforming to their boundaries directly from volumetric data. Both material change edges and interior edges are analyzed to construct tetrahedral meshes, and interior grid points are analyzed for proper hexahedral mesh construction. Finally, edge-contraction and smoothing methods are used to improve the quality of tetrahedral meshes, and a combination of pillowing, geometric flow and optimization techniques is used for hexahedral mesh quality improvement. The shrink set of pillowing schemes is defined automatically as the boundary of each material region. Several application results of our multi-material mesh generation method are also provided.

These equations, however, are less structured than those of finite element methods and hence cost-effectiveness is not as clear cut as might be expected. Both direct and iterative solution techniques are examined. For interior problems finite element methods are more economical on most practical configurations. Finite elements also appear to possess a certain computational advantage on the exterior problems examined, and, in general, are definitely competitive with boundary element methods.

  doi = {10/bcbccx},
  abstract = {The multiscale approach to strain localization problems developed earlier, is generalized to higher dimensions. The key idea is the identification of the line scale field with a component of the displacement that has a large gradient. The difference between the total displacement and the line scale is the coarse scale field. The formulation is variationally based, with the weak form as the point of departure. With suitable assumptions on the space of fine scale fields, the weak form is separable into coarse and fine scale parts. The weak form of the Fine scale problem is used to eliminate the fine scales from the formulation. This is achieved by way of a projection onto the line scale space and allows a reformulation of the full problem in terms of coarse scale components alone. In this framework, fine scale interpolations are identified that ensure sharp resolution of localized displacement irrespective of the underlying finite element mesh. It is demonstrated that by correctly accounting for the ``microstructural'' fine scale behavior, the formulation results in solutions devoid of pathological mesh sensitivity. For problems wherein the detailed structure of the localized displacement is of interest, recovery of the fine scale components can be performed to reconstruct the entire displacement field. Several numerical examples are presented that demonstrate the robustness of the formulation. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.},

The NURBS-based isogeometric analysis method, proposed by Hughes et al. (Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Eng. 2005; 194:4135-4195) was used for the numerical tests. Effects of various parameters in the definition of the YZ beta operator are examined on a model problem and the better performer is singled out.

  abstract = {Increasing mathematical analysis of finite element methods is motivating the inclusion of mesh-dependent terms in new classes of methods for a variety of applications. Several inequalities of functional analysis are often employed in convergence proofs. In the following, Poincare-Friedrichs inequalities, inverse estimates and least-squares bounds are characterized as tools for the error analysis and practical design of finite element methods with terms that depend on the mesh parameter. Sharp estimates of the constants of these inequalities are provided, and precise definitions of mesh size that arise naturally in the context of different problems in terms of element geometry are derived.},

  abstract = {We compare isogeometric collocation with isogeometric Galerkin and standard C-0 finite element methods with respect to the cost of forming the matrix and residual vector, the cost of direct and iterative solvers, the accuracy versus degrees of freedom and the accuracy versus computing time. On this basis, we show that isogeometric collocation has the potential to increase the computational efficiency of isogeometric analysis and to outperform both isogeometric Galerkin and standard C-0 finite element methods, when a specified level of accuracy is to be achieved with minimum computational cost. We then explore an adaptive isogeometric collocation method that is based on local hierarchical refinement of NURBS basis functions and collocation points derived from the corresponding multi-level Greville abscissae. We introduce the concept of weighted collocation that can be consistently developed from the weighted residual form and the two-scale relation of B-splines. Using weighted collocation in the transition regions between hierarchical levels, we are able to reliably handle coincident collocation points that naturally occur for multi-level Greville abscissae. The resulting method combines the favorable properties of isogeometric collocation and hierarchical refinement in terms of computational efficiency, local adaptivity, robustness and straightforward implementation, which we illustrate by numerical examples in one, two and three dimensions.

In fact, only the shape function subroutine needs to be modified while all other aspects of a finite element program remain the same.

  abstract = {Purpose: The beneficial effect of exercise in the retardation of the progression of cardiovascular disease is hypothesized to be caused, at least in part, by the elimination of adverse hemodynamic conditions, including flow recirculation and low wall shear stress. In vitro and in vivo investigations have provided qualitative and limited quantitative information on flow patterns in the abdominal aorta and on the effect of exercise on the elimination of adverse hemodynamic conditions. We used computational fluid mechanics methods to examine the effects of simulated exercise on hemodynamic conditions in an idealized model of the human abdominal aorta. Methods: A three-dimensional computer model of a healthy human abdominal aorta was created to simulate pulsatile aortic blood flow under conditions of rest and graded exercise. Plow velocity patterns and wall shear stress were computed in the lesion-prone infrarenal aorta, and the effects of exercise were determined. Results: A recirculation zone was observed to form along the posterior wall of the aorta immediately distal to the renal vessels under resting conditions. Low time-averaged wall shear stress was present in this location, along the posterior wall opposite the superior mesenteric artery and along the anterior wall between the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries. Shear stress temporal oscillations, as measured with an oscillatory shear index, were elevated in these regions. Under simulated Light exercise conditions, a region of low wall shear stress and high oscillatory shear index remained along the posterior wall immediately distal to the renal arteries. Under simulated moderate exercise conditions, all the regions of low wall shear stress and high oscillatory shear index were eliminated. Conclusion: This numeric investigation provided detailed quantitative data on the effect of exercise on hemodynamic conditions in the abdominal aorta. Our results indicated that moderate levels of lower limb exercise are necessary to eliminate the flow reversal and regions of low wall shear stress in the abdominal aorta that exist under resting conditions. The lack of flow reversal and increased wall shear stress during exercise suggest a mechanism by which exercise may promote arterial health, namely with the elimination of adverse hemodynamic conditions.},

Some, such as subdivision surfaces, may not have convenient analytical representations. The concept of an element, if appropriate at all, no longer coincides with the traditional definition. Developing a new software for each new class of basis functions is a large research burden, especially, if the problems involve large deformations, non-linear materials, and contact. The objective of this paper is to present a method that separates as much as possible the generation and evaluation of the basis functions from the analysis, resulting in a formulation that can be implemented within the traditional structure of a finite clement program but that permits the use of arbitrary sets of basis functions that are defined only through the input file. Elements ranging from a traditional linear four-node tetrahedron through a higher-order element combining XFEM and isogeometric analysis may be specified entirely through an input file without any additional programming.

The formula is expressed in terms of the classical Green's function and a projector which defines the decomposition of the solution into coarse and. ne scales. The theory is presented in an abstract operator format and subsequently specialized for the advection-diffusion equation. It is shown that different projectors lead to fine-scale Green's functions with very different properties. For example, in the advection-dominated case, the projector induced by the H-0(1)-seminorm produces a fine-scale Green's function which is highly attenuated and localized. These are very desirable properties in a multiscale method and ones that are not shared by the L-2-projector. By design, the coarse-scale solution attains optimality in the norm associated with the projector. This property, combined with a localized fine-scale Green's function, indicates the possibility of effective methods with local character for dominantly hyperbolic problems. The constructs lead to a new class of stabilized methods, and the relationship between H-0(1)-optimality and the streamline-upwind Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) method is described.},

  doi = {10/b254th},
  abstract = {In turbulence applications, strongly imposed no-slip conditions often lead to inaccurate mean flow quantities for coarse boundarylayer meshes. To circumvent this shortcoming, weakly imposed Dirichlet boundary conditions for fluid dynamics were recently introduced in [Y. Bazilevs, T.J.R. Hughes, Weak imposition of Dirichlet boundary conditions in fluid mechanics, Comput. Fluids 36 (2007) 12-26]. In the present work, we propose a modification of the original weak boundary condition formulation that consistently incorporates the well-known ``law of the wall''. To compare the different methods, we conduct numerical experiments for turbulent channel flow at Reynolds number 395 and 950. In the limit of vanishing mesh size in the wall-normal direction, the weak boundary condition acts like a strong boundary condition. Accordingly, strong and weak boundary conditions give essentially identical results on meshes that are stretched to better capture boundary layers. However, on uniform meshes that are incapable of resolving boundary layers, weakly imposed boundary conditions deliver significantly more accurate mean flow quantities than their strong counterparts. Hence, weakly imposed boundary conditions present a robust technique for flows of industrial interest, where optimal mesh design is usually not feasible and resolving boundary layers is prohibitively expensive. Our numerical results show that the formulation that incorporates the law of the wall yields an improvement over the original method. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Conventional finite shell element formulations use rotational degrees of freedom to describe the motion of the fiber in the Reissner-Mindlin shear deformable shell theory, resulting in an element with five or six degrees of freedom per node. These additional degrees of freedom are frequently the source of convergence difficulties in implicit structural analyses, and, unless the rotational inertias are scaled, control the time step size in explicit analyses. Structural formulations that are based on only the translational degrees of freedom are therefore attractive. Although rotation-free formulations using C(0) basis functions are possible, they are complicated in comparison to their C(1) counterparts. A C(k)-continuous, k $>$= 1, NURBS-based isogeometric shell for large deformations formulated without rotational degrees of freedom is presented here. The effect of different choices for defining the shell normal vector is demonstrated using a simple eigenvalue problem, and a simple lifting operator is shown to provide the most accurate solution. Higher order elements are commonly regarded as inefficient for large deformation analyses, but a traditional shell benchmark problem demonstrates the contrary for isogeometric analysis. The rapid convergence of the quadratic element is demonstrated for the NUMISHEET S-rail benchmark metal stamping problem. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

A circular fillet patch is introduced through the appropriate degeneration of a control mesh in order to address the problem of modeling small features in finite element models.

This incompatibility is handled by using a weak enforcement of the continuity of solution fields at the interface of the stationary and rotating subdomains.},

The basis for studying overshoot is discussed and the optimal collocation and $\alpha$ methods are compared. It is found that pathological overshooting is an inherent property of collocation schemes, whereas the overshooting characteristics of the $\alpha$ methods are good.},

It is of considerable interest and import to investigate the stabilization of zwitterionic structures in the gas phase. Infrared multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD) spectroscopy is a very powerful and sensitive technique, which may elucidate clearly the structures of both ions and ionic clusters in the gas phase, since it provides IR vibrational fingerprint information. The structures of the clusters of glycine and ammonium ion and of the betaine proton-bound homodimer have been investigated using IRMPD spectroscopy, in combination with electronic structure calculations. The experimental and calculated results indicate that zwitterionic structure of glycine may be effectively stabilized by an ammonium ion. This is the smallest zwitterionic structure of an amino acid to be demonstrated in the gas phase. On the basis of the experimental IRMPD and calculated results, it is very clear that a zwitterionic structure exists in the proton-bound betaine dimer. The proton is bound to one of the carboxylate oxygens of betaine, rather than being equally shared. Investigations of zwitterionic structures in the isolated state are essential for an understanding of the intrinsic characteristics of zwitterions and salt bridge interactions in biological systems.

The application of such methods to higher-order equations is studied with the result that new techniques for both first- and higher-order equations are found.The direct approach to higher-order equations is believed to offer speed and accuracy advantages; some numerical evidence is presented. The new technique applied to first-order equations is a slight extension of the conventional multistep method and avoids the Dahlquist [2] stability theorem, that is, these new k-step methods are of order 2k and yet convergent. The matrix formalism introduced provides an easy mechanism for examining the equivalence of methods as introduced by Descloux [3]. It is pointed out that the new first-order method on k-steps, Adams' method on (2k - 1)-steps and Nordsieck's [7] method with 2k components are equivalent to each other. In fact, all methods discussed can be placed in equivalence classes so that theorems need only be proved for one member of each class. The choice between the members of a class can be made on the basis of round-off errors and amount of computation only. Arguments are given in favor of the extension of Nordsieck's method for general use because of its speed and applicability to higher order problems directly. The theorems ensuring convergence and giving the asymptotic form of the error are stated. The proofs can be found in a cited report.},

We derive new, strongly S-stable diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta formulae of order 2 in 2 stages and of order 3 in 3 stages, and show that it is impossible for a strongly S-stable diagonally implicit method to attain order 4 in 4 stages. Merely A-stable diagonally implicit formulae, of order 3 in 2 stages and of order 4 in 3 stages, were previously known; we prove that no 4-stage method of this type has order 5. We describe a computer program for stiff differential equations which uses these methods, and compare them to each other and to the GEAR package.},

  abstract = {Mathematical models when simulating the behavior of physical, chemical, and biological systems often include one or more ordinary differential equations (ODEs). To study the system behavior predicted by a model, these equations are usually solved numerically.Although many of the current methods for solving ODEs were developed around the turn of the century, the past 15 years or so has been a period of intensive research. The emphasis of this survey is on the methods and techniques used in software for solving ODEs.ODEs can be classified as stiff or nonstiff, and may be stiff for some parts of an interval and nonstiff for others. We discuss stiff equations, why they are difficult to solve, and methods and software for solving both nonstiff and stiff equations. We conclude this review by looking at techniques for dealing with special problems that may arise in some ODEs, for example, discontinuities.Although important theoretical developments have also taken place, we report only those developments which have directly affected the software and provide a review of this research. We present the basic concepts involved but assume that the reader has some background in numerical computing, such as a first course in numerical methods.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT There is growing interest in the potential utility of real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in diagnosing bloodstream infection by detecting pathogen deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in blood samples within a few hours. SeptiFast (Roche Diagnostics GmBH, Mannheim, Germany) is a multipathogen probe-based system targeting ribosomal DNA sequences of bacteria and fungi. It detects and identifies the commonest pathogens causing bloodstream infection. As background to this study, we report a systematic review of Phase III diagnostic accuracy studies of SeptiFast, which reveals uncertainty about its likely clinical utility based on widespread evidence of deficiencies in study design and reporting with a high risk of bias. Determine the accuracy of SeptiFast real-time PCR for the detection of health-care-associated bloodstream infection, against standard microbiological culture. Prospective multicentre Phase III clinical diagnostic accuracy study using the standards for the reporting of diagnostic accuracy studies criteria. Critical care departments within NHS hospitals in the north-west of England. Adult patients requiring blood culture (BC) when developing new signs of systemic inflammation. SeptiFast real-time PCR results at species/genus level compared with microbiological culture in association with independent adjudication of infection. Metrics of diagnostic accuracy were derived including sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios and predictive values, with their 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). Latent class analysis was used to explore the diagnostic performance of culture as a reference standard. Of 1006 new patient episodes of systemic inflammation in 853 patients, 922 (92\%) met the inclusion criteria and provided sufficient information for analysis. Index test assay failure occurred on 69 (7\%) occasions. Adult patients had been exposed to a median of 8 days (interquartile range 4-16 days) of hospital care, had high levels of organ support activities and recent antibiotic exposure. SeptiFast real-time PCR, when compared with culture-proven bloodstream infection at species/genus level, had better specificity (85.8\%, 95\% CI 83.3\% to 88.1\%) than sensitivity (50\%, 95\% CI 39.1\% to 60.8\%). When compared with pooled diagnostic metrics derived from our systematic review, our clinical study revealed lower test accuracy of SeptiFast real-time PCR, mainly as a result of low diagnostic sensitivity. There was a low prevalence of BC-proven pathogens in these patients (9.2\%, 95\% CI 7.4\% to 11.2\%) such that the post-test probabilities of both a positive (26.3\%, 95\% CI 19.8\% to 33.7\%) and a negative SeptiFast test (5.6\%, 95\% CI 4.1\% to 7.4\%) indicate the potential limitations of this technology in the diagnosis of bloodstream infection. However, latent class analysis indicates that BC has a low sensitivity, questioning its relevance as a reference test in this setting. Using this analysis approach, the sensitivity of the SeptiFast test was low but also appeared significantly better than BC. Blood samples identified as positive by either culture or SeptiFast real-time PCR were associated with a high probability ($>$ 95\%) of infection, indicating higher diagnostic rule-in utility than was apparent using conventional analyses of diagnostic accuracy. SeptiFast real-time PCR on blood samples may have rapid rule-in utility for the diagnosis of health-care-associated bloodstream infection but the lack of sensitivity is a significant limiting factor. Innovations aimed at improved diagnostic sensitivity of real-time PCR in this setting are urgently required. Future work recommendations include technology developments to improve the efficiency of pathogen DNA extraction and the capacity to detect a much broader range of pathogens and drug resistance genes and the application of new statistical approaches able to more reliably assess test performance in situation where the reference standard (e.g. blood culture in the setting of high antimicrobial use) is prone to error.

In this way, liquids have been deionised so effectively that their resistivities have been increased by three orders of magnitude as compared with previously published values.

Removal of trace impurities from liquids may help to clarify mechanisms of electrical conduction, charge injection, and charge exchange phenomena in polar liquids.

An integral over an infinite interval may have to be transformed into an integral over an infinite interval first. A definite integral can be approximated numerically as the weighted average over a finite number of function values. Specific sets of quadrature points and quadrature weights are known as ``integral rules''. Newton-Cotes rules use equidistant points and are easy to apply. Accuracy can be improved by dividing the integration range into sub-intervals and applying composite Newton-Cotes rules. Extrapolation methods reduce the error almost to machine precision but need many function evaluations. Equidistant sample points are convenient but not the best choice. Clenshaw-Curtis expressions use non uniform sample points and a rapidly converging Chebyshev expansion. Gaussian integration fully optimizes the sample points with the help of orthogonal polynomials.},

A simple but very effective method is derived to optimize the location of the collocation point (where plastic consistency is enforced) in order to achieve high accuracy for virtually unlimited sizes of the lime step. These optimal locations are in the interval [Delta t/2, Delta t], which automatically guarantees unconditional stability. The optimal weighting parameter theta is estimated from two explicit formulas. Hence, there is practically no increase in computational expense compared to applications of the conventional generalized midpoint rule. Furthermore, the method features a special formulation of plastic consistency, called a plastic predictor, which minimizes the necessary iterations at Gauss-point level. Numerical examples demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the algorithm for rate-dependent and rate-independent plasticity including combined kinematic and isotropic hardening, as well as thermal softening.},

In addition, the algorithm, when used, eliminates the negative effect of "overshooting". Several simple test cases are demonstrated to show improvements and its suitability for simulation of low-frequency transformer transients such as inrush currents and ferroresonance. The realized hysteresis model can be incorporated in the EMTP-ATP by using the simplest combination of existing trapezoidal and proposed BDF method of order 1, known as theta method.},

In each step of these methods an algebraic Riccati equation is obtained, which is solved by means of Newton's method. In the standard approach, this system is transformed into a Sylvester equation, which could be solved by means of the well-known Bartels-Stewart method. In our code, we obtain a system of linear equations, defined from a Kronecker product of matrices related to coefficient matrices of the differential Riccati equation, that is solved by means of the iterative generalized minimum residual (GMRES) method. We have also implemented an efficient matrix-vector product in order to reduce the computational and storage cost of the GMRES method. The above approach has been applied in the development of an algorithm to solve differential Riccati equations. The accuracy and efficiency of this algorithm has been compared with the BDF algorithm that uses the Bartels-Stewart method.

Much research has been done by the scientific community on developing numerical methods which can provide an approximate solution of the original ODE. In this work, two approaches have been considered based on BDF and Piecewise-linearized Methods. The approach based on BDF methods uses a Chord-Shamanskii iteration for computing the nonlinear system which is obtained when the BDF schema is used. Two approaches based on piecewise-linearized methods have also been considered. These approaches are based on a theorem proved in this paper which allows to compute the approximate solution at each time step by means of a block-oriented method based on diagonal Pade\&acute; approximations. The difference between these implementations is in using or not using the scale and squaring technique. Five algorithms based on these approaches have been developed. MATLAB and Fortran versions of the above algorithms have been developed, comparing both precision and computational costs. BLAS and LAPACK libraries have been used in Fortran implementations. In order to compare in equality of conditions all implementations, algorithms with fixed step have been considered. Four of the five case studies analyzed come from biology and chemical kinetics stiff problems.

In this paper we present two contributions to improve the above algorithms. Firstly six variants of previous algorithms are carried out by using one of above algorithms in the first step and another algorithm to carry out the other steps until reaching convergence. Numerous tests on four case studies have been done comparing both precision and computational costs of MATLAB implementations of the above algorithms. Experimental results show that in some cases these algorithms improve on the speed and convergence of the original algorithms. Secondly, using the previous experimental results and since all algorithms have a similar structure and there is no best algorithm to solve all problems, two general-purpose adaptive algorithms have been designed for selecting the most appropriate algorithm, which can be chosen using a parameter that indicates the stiffness of the DMRE to be solved.},

  title = {Evaluating the Effect of the Eigenvalues on {{BDF}} Classifier in Face Detection},
  copyright = {Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.},
  abstract = {Principal component analysis (PCA) is an effective tool for dimension reduction in classification approaches. Bayesian discriminating features (BDF) is a classifier which effectively utilizes this tool. In this classifier, any of the M largest eigenvalues of the training patterns' covariance matrix are individually involved in classification while the arithmetic average of the remaining eigenvalues take part just as a single parameter. In this paper, by suggesting a new classifier, effect of the number of involved eigenvalues in classification performance is studied. In the suggested classifier we ignore the arithmetic average that is utilized in BDF. Our experiments verify that increasing M does not lead to an ongoing increase in classifier's detection rate in both BDF and the proposed one. However, by over-increasing M, the dependency of classifiers' parameters to the training samples increases which could reduce the performance of the classifiers when they come to make decision about new samples. Furthermore, experimental results verify that arithmetic average of the remaining eigenvalues in BDF improves the classifier performance only when an appropriate number of eigenvalues is selected; hence, ignoring the arithmetic average, as done in proposed classifier, could provide a better performance rather than BDF. \&copy; 2011 IEEE.},

In contrast to the traditonal setting of Newtonian mechanics with vector formalism where most developments are routinely conducted, and also in contrast to other frameworks with scalar formalism such as Lagrangian and Hamiltonian, the paper introduces new avenues and computationally convenient and attractive alternatives via the so-called Total Energy framework in configuration space. A measurable built in scalar descriptive function is employed via the Total Enery framework which is very natural for numerical discretizations to be routinely conducted, and it provides good and improved physical insight and computationally attractive features. In particular, although the equivalences of the various frameworks can be shown for holonomic-sceleronomic systems, the focus of this expositon and equivalences and the developments underlying conserving algorithms by design are strictly limited to the additonal restrictions, namely, the mass matrix is constant and the kinteic energy is not dependent upon the generalized coordinates. Past efforts via various original methods of development can be also be readily explained, and various conserving algorithms by design are presented with simple illustrative examples.

Of the various computational frameworks (Newtonian, Lagrangian, Hamiltonian, and Total Energy) that we presented in Part 1, here in Part 2 of the exposition we particularly describe and advocate the so-called Total Energy computational framework for elastodynamics applications. This is because it is a self-contained framework in a natural setting which is computationally attractive. Consequently, it naturally enables the design of structure preserving time integration algorithms, and also inherits the advantages of readily ensuring proof of satisfaction of the conservation laws for the space discretized system. In contrast to Part 1, here in Part 2 of the paper we altogether discard the developments starting from the continuous representations to derive the semi-discretized equations. Instead, we describe yet another route directly starting from the supposition of energy conservation for the space discretized system. In particular, via the Total Energy framework, simply for illustration we describe the design of computational algorithms that are energy-momentum conserving within the scope of the particular class of LMS methods involving a single system of equations with a single solve within a single step representation, since these are the most popular in commercial codes. We demonstrate conserving algorithms by design for linear dynamic systems, which is a necessary first step and basis that is required for consequent extensions of the parent linear dynamics algorithms to general nonlinear dynamic applications, which we hope to disseminate in the near future.

Restricting attention to these considerations, new and different perspectives and equivalences are described which deal with finite element space discretization aspects employing three distinctly different frameworks with scalar formalism. It encompasses the Lagrangian mechanics, the Hamiltonian mechanics, and as an alternative, the framework with a built-in measurable quantity based on the Total Energy. Historically, traditional practices routinely employ the weighted residual method or equivalently the principle of virtual work in dynamics for developing finite element formulations. In contrast, the present developments stem from Hamilton's law of varying action (HLVA) as a starting point and involve distinctly different scalar descriptive functions (the Lagrangian [L(q,q): TQ \&rarr \&Rdbl;], the Hamiltonian [H(p,q): T*Q \&rarr \&Rdbl;], or the Total Energy [E(q,q):TQ \&rarr \&Rdbl;]). These developments naturally embody the weak form in space and the statement of the weighted residual in time. Complicated structural dynamical systems such as a rotating bar and the Timoshenko beam are particularly shown here simply for illustration. In Part 2, we describe the satisfaction of conservation properties of the fully discretized equations of motion in space and time with particular attention to the Total Energy framework (in contrast to the Lagrangian and the Hamiltonian), primarily because it is very natural and is computationally attractive and meaningful to conducting the time discretization [1] process. Instead of starting from the continuous form of representations, the particular focus is upon directly employing the discrete formulations for enabling algorithmic designs for the class of LMS methods for linear dynamic problems for illustration purposes. This is a necessary first step in the design of algorithms for integrating the equations of motion, and they serve as the parent algorithms for subsequent extensions to nonlinear dynamic problems.

  abstract = {Previously, in Part I (see [1]) of this three-part exposition, we described for the first time for the particular class of LMS methods involving a single system and a single solve within each time step, which are the predominant methods in commercial and research software, how and why the equation of motion needs to be evaluated at precise time levels (which, in general, are not known to date) for ensuring correct algorithm designs. Here in Part II of this exposition, focusing attention on this class of LMS methods, a novel displacement based normalized time weighted residual approach is presented that naturally leads to new designs of a family of numerically non-dissipative (which are of focus here) symplectic-momentum conserving time integration operators without enforcing added or artificial constraints. The objectives are to foster the simulation of nonlinear structural dynamic problems for long-term durations. For illustration, the focus is on the Saint Venant Kirchoff material although the method can be readily extended to general material models (Part III ([2]) further shows extensions of this paper to additionally include controllable numerical dissipation for nonlinear dynamics applications to address issues associated with undesirable participation of the unresolved high frequency modes induced due to spatial discretization). The theoretical developments are described for nonlinear dynamics applications via extensions of the well-known Generalized Single Step Single Solve (GSSSS) linear dynamic framework, which encompasses the class of LMS methods in the single field form. In principle, this framework comprises two distinct classifications, namely, constrained U and V algorithmic architectures (characterized by the overshoot behavior) and was originally developed for designing linear dynamic algorithms using a generalization of the classical time weighted residual method. However, the problem with the classical approach is that it fails to adequately provide proper extensions to nonlinear dynamics applications as illustrated in this paper. In contrast to the classical approach, and also different from other approaches of designing algorithms, we show in this paper, via the new displacement based normalized time weighted residual approach, how to design symplectic-momentum time integrators that are implicit, and maintain second-order time accuracy for the class of general nonlinear inertial dynamics applications. For linear dynamic framework, the present concepts readily revert to the classical approach. Numerical illustrations are presented that demonstrate the computational and implementation aspects for nonlinear structural dynamics applications.},

In contrast, a new normalized time-weighted residual approach is proposed that naturally enables such extensions leading to the design of a family of conserving time operators for unconstrained conservative dynamic systems without resorting to enforcing energy constraints as in past practices. Consequently, the algorithmic stability (in the sense of energy stability) via this approach for non-linear dynamic problems is also preserved. For linear dynamic situations, it reverts to the classical paradigm.

This has placed major limitations on commercial code developers, and a lack of confidence in general, thereby restricting the implementation of LMS methods to only a select few that happen to be correct, but without any rigorous proofs or underlying reasons explaining the ramifications. This is extremely critical for the general cases of integration of the equations of motion, in particular for the class of Linear Multi-Step (LMS) that are implicit, involve a single solve, and are second-order accurate in time with unconditional stability (this pertains to linear dynamic situations only), since these serve as the backbone and drivers for most finite element commercial and research software. In this regard, the present Part I of the three-part exposition puts the matter to rest and provides closure, while in Part II (see Ref [1]) and Part III (see Ref [2]) we describe extensions to nonlinear dynamics applications of the basic general framework for the classes of nondissipative and controllable numerical dissipative methods, respectively. Within the confines of these LMS methods, particular attention is paid to designing algorithms that are symplectic-momentum preserving, and with enhancements to include controllable dissipative features and optimal algorithm designs.

  copyright = {Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.},
  abstract = {A novel approach termed as the hybrid displacement-strain based normalized time weighted residual approach is presented in this exposition to accurately solve nonlinear structural dynamic problems. The current work concentrates on the design of a family of conserving time operators which preserve energy, linear and angular momentum conservation properties via this new innovative approach to solve nonlinear dynamic problems. The focus of this work is on Generalized Single Step Single Solve (GSSSS) computational algorithms which encompass the entire framework of those termed as linear multi-step (LMS) methods with unconditional stability and second-order accuracy which are most commonly used for such applications. In general, there exist three roots for LMS based methods, namely, the two principal roots \&rho;1\&infin;$<$/inf$>$, \&rho;2\&infin;$<$/inf$>$, and the spurious root \&rho;3\&infin;$<$/inf$>$. The LMS framework is comprised of two distinct algorithmic structures termed as constrained U and V algorithms. Specifically, it is shown that in the sense of LMS methods, the implementation of V0 algorithms (zero oder velocity overshoot behavior) via the hybrid displacement-strain based normalized weighted residual approach (no external constraints on energy are imposed) with (\&rho;1\&infin;$<$/inf$>$, \&rho;2\&infin;$<$/inf$>$, \&rho;3\&infin;$<$/inf$>$ = 1.00,1.00, any \&rho;3\&infin;$<$/inf$>$ \&isin; [0.00,1.00] readily conserve energy, linear momentum and angular momentum. Although the displacement and velocity are independent of \&rho;3\&infin;$<$/inf$>$, it is shown and proved that different choices of \&rho;3\&infin;$<$/inf$>$ gives different values of acceleration at every time step, thus yielding a different algorithm within the family. Nevertheless, in the sense of LMS methods, the entire family results in energy and momentum conserving algorithms regardless of the selection of \&rho;3\&infin;$<$/inf$>$ since only displacement and velocity participate in the algorithm as clearly presented in this paper. Numerious numerical illustration are presented to demonstrate the fundamental principles. Copyright \&copy; 2008 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The design and development of a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) formulation for linear shell problems is presented in this paper. Discontinuous approximations for displacement and stress fields are employed as independent unknowns. Through the properties associated with the inter-element discontinuities the present class of DG methods provide an additional mechanism to alleviate locking in shells. These properties are introduced by means of a suitable definition of numerical fluxes at the element interfaces. Degenerated bilinear quadrilateral element is used as an example, however, the formulation presented here is quite general and easily extendible to elements of other type and order. To demonstrate the effects of the DG approach to shell problems two different formulations of the elements themselves are considered, one with equal order approximations for displacement and stresses and the other with modified stresses (used in continuous finite element approach to eliminate locking). These two element formulations are then used within the DG framework. The results indicate that the DG approach can lead to significant improvements if the inter-element interface properties are selected properly, and several numerical examples are presented to support this feature. However, a rational method of selecting these interface attributes and the associated error estimates are still under investigation. \&copy; 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

For the first time, we provide a resolution to this issue and point-out several noteworthy perspective to address the correct evaluation of acceleration computations for structural dynamics applications with focus on LMS methods as an illustration.

  abstract = {While in Part I (see [1]) and Part II (see [2]) of this three-part exposition we focused attention on non-dissipative symplectic-momentum conserving designs of time operators for applicability to nonlinear dynamics, here in Part III of this exposition we demonstrate how to further advance the theoretical developments and introduce controllable numerical dissipation via a novel time weighted residual approach we have previously described. The unique aspects of the algorithmic designs are such that when the numerical dissipative features are turned off, the resulting time operators readily recover the original designs of algorithms that are inherently symplectic-momentum conserving (we defer to those that are energy-momentum conserving elsewhere [3, 4]). The focus of the current work is on the theoretical developments of the new formulation termed the displacement based normalized time weighted residual approach for nonlinear dynamics applications. In particular, we provide extensions of the wellknown Generalized Single Solve Single Step (GSSSS) framework, which comprises two distinct classifications, namely constrained U and V algorithmic architectures, and was originally developed for solving linear dynamic problems. Starting with the generalization of the classical time weighted residual approach, the GSSSS framework that was previously developed encompasses the general class of LMS methods represented by the single field form of the second order ordinary differential equations in time involving a single solve, and also covers most of the developments to date in the literature, including providing new avenues towards optimal designs of algorithms. However, the classical time weighted residual approach fails to adequately provide proper extensions to nonlinear dynamics applications. Consequently, the basic premise and argument that is herein advanced is that controllable numerical dissipative time operators designed for linear dynamic problems are very valuable, and are indeed the basis and can be readily employed as the basic parent algorithms, such that when implemented appropriately via the present new time weighted residual representation, they are now readily suitable for extensions to nonlinear dynamics applications. To demonstrate the basic concepts, we consider applications to the Saint Venant Kirchhoff material model simply for illustration, although the method can be readily extended to general material models. The numerical examples presented show that in contrast to the classical time weighted residual approach, which fails to recover the original designs of symplectic-momentum conservation when numerical dissipation is turned off, this new approach readily accomplishes this feature naturally and without enforcing any added constraints, and is the more appropriate way to design a particular class of controllable numerical dissipative schemes. It also leads to algorithm designs that yield fewer numerical oscillations in the energy and angular momentum in contrast to the classical approach, thus additionally confirming the improved effectiveness of the proposed approach. Further, we also show that amongst all the controllable numerical dissipative schemes considered in the sense of and under the framework of LMS methods in the single field form and involving a single solve and second-order time accuracy, the U0- V0optimal is the preferred choice of this particular class of symplectic-momentum conserving based controllable numerical dissipative schemes since: (i) it yields least amount of energy dissipation; and (ii) it is ideal for any given set of initial conditions in the sense that it possesses the highly desirable attributes involving zero order displacement and velocity overshooting behavior. Simple numerical examples are provided that illustrate the fundamental ideas for applications to nonlinear dynamics problems.},

  abstract = {A new unified theory underlying the theoretical design of linear computational algorithms in the context of time dependent first-order systems is presented. Providing for the first time new perspectives and fresh ideas, and unlike various formulations existing in the literature, the present unified theory involves the following considerations: (i) it leads to new avenues for designing new computational algorithms to foster the notion of algorithms by design and recovering existing algorithms in the literature, (ii) describes a theory for the evolution of time operators via a unified mathematical framework, and (iii) places into context and explains/contrasts future new developments including existing designs and the various relationships among the different classes of algorithms in the literature such as linear multi-step methods, sub-stepping methods, Runge-Kutta type methods, higher-order time accurate methods, etc. Subsequently, it provides design criteria and guidelines for contrasting and evaluating time dependent computational algorithms. The linear computational algorithms in the context of first-order systems are classified as distinctly pertaining to Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3 classifications of time discretized operators. Such a distinct classification, provides for the first time, new avenues for designing new computational algorithms not existing in the literature and recovering existing algorithms of arbitrary order of time accuracy including an overall assessment of their stability and other algorithmic attributes. Consequently, it enables the evaluation and provides the relationships of computational algorithms for time dependent problems via a standardized measure based on computational effort and memory usage in terms of the resulting number of equation systems and the corresponding number of system solves. A generalized stability and accuracy limitation barrier theorem underlies the generic designs of computational algorithms with arbitrary order of accuracy and establishes guidelines which cannot be circumvented. In summary, unlike the traditional approaches and classical school of thought customarily employed in the theoretical development of computational algorithms, the unified theory underlying time dependent first-order systems serves as a viable avenue to foster the notion of algorithms by design. \&copy; 2004 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {For computational dynamics problems, direct time integration and mode superposition are the most widely employed approaches. Of the two, direct time stepping methods have been quite popular in many commercial codes because of their various inherent advantages. However, for numerous engineering applications, mode superposition techniques continue to be the choice of many analysts, especially for linear systems and for long time responses. To date, much progress has been made in the development and understanding of direct time integration methods for computational dynamics problems encountered in engineering. Besides investigations encompassing accuracy and stability properties of these time integration schemes, the related developments include single step, multi-step, mixed and/or variable time integration features and the like. Unlike past practices customarily employed for computational dynamics, the present paper introduces a new VIrtual-Pulse (VIP) time integral methodology which offers several attractive and effective features. The proposed method possesses a unique solution methodology of its own, thus avoiding the need to employ any existing time stepping methods. The present paper primarily serves to lay down the fundamental developments towards establishing the theoretical basis via new perspectives for subsequent applications to general computational structural dynamics. However, for expository purposes, attention is confined only to linear structural dynamic systems in this paper; and Rayleigh damping is considered here, although non-Rayleigh damping can be readily permitted but is not described here. As a consequence, the characteristics of the methodology include: 1) an explicit unconditionally stable representation, 2) second-order accuracy, 3) much less algorithmic damping than direct time integration methods advocated in existing commercial codes; if an undamped system is considered, the algorithmic damping is zero, 4) the relative period error is zero, and 5) self-starting features. Theoretical details of the developments, the stability and accuracy characteristics are described. Illustrative numerical examples are presented to validate the proposed methodology for computational dynamic problems.},

For transient analysis, explicit time operators readily inherit algorithmic scalability and consequently enable parallel scalability. However, the key issues concerning parallel simulations via implicit time operators within the framework and encompassing the class of linear multistep methods include the totality of the following considerations to foster the proposed notion of A-scalability: (a) selection of robust scalable optimal time discretized operators that foster stabilized non-linear dynamic implicit computations both in terms of convergence and the number of non-linear iterations for completion of large-scale analysis of the highly non-linear dynamic responses, (b) selecting an appropriate scalable spatial domain decomposition method for solving the resulting linearized system of equations during the implicit phase of the nonlinear computations, (c) scalable implementation models and solver technology for the interface and coarse problems for attaining parallel scalability of the computations, and (d) scalable parallel graph partitioning techniques. These latter issues related to parallel implicit formulations are of interest and focus in this paper.

The key feature is the incorporation of a spurious root to introduce controllable numerical dissipation while preserving second-order accuracy (order-preserving feature) resulting in a two-root system, namely, the principal root (18) and a spurious root (28). In contrast to the classical Trapezoidal family of algorithms which are the most popular, the present framework has the same order of computational complexity, but a higher payoff that is a significant advance to the field for tackling a wide class of applications dealing with first-order transient systems. We also present the special case with selection of 18 = 1 and any 28 leading to the design of a family of generalized single-step single-solve [GS4-1] algorithms recovering the CrankNicolson method at one end (28 = 1) and the Midpoint Rule at the other end (28 = 0) and anything in between, all of which have spectral radius features resembling that of the CrankNicolson method. More interestingly, with the particular choice of 18 = 28 = 0, the developed framework additionally inherits L-stable features.

  abstract = {An overview of recent advances in computational dynamics for modeling and simulation is described. The targeted objectives are towards a wide variety of science and engineering applications in particle and continuum dynamics of structures and materials which fall in this class. Starting with the supposition that in the beginning, the well known Newton's law of motion for N-body systems is given, and is a statement of the principle of balance of linear momentum, subsequently, using this as a landmark, firstly, the principal relations to various other distinctly different fundamental principles which are of primary interest here are established. Likewise, for continuum dynamics of structures, via the principle of balance of linear momentum, analogous developments are also established. Consequently, these distinctly different fundamental principles are shown to serve as the starting point for the various developments. Stemming from three distinctly different fundamental principles, we present recent advances in N-body dynamical systems, and also continuous-body dynamical systems with focus on numerical aspects in space/time discretization. The fundamental principles are the following: the Principle of Virtual Work in Dynamics, Hamilton's Principle and as an alternate (due to inconsistencies associated with Hamilton's principle), Hamilton's Law of Varying Action, and the Principle of Balance of Mechanical Energy. Both vector and scalar formalisms are described in detail with particular focus towards general numerical discretizations in space and/or time for N-body and continuum-elastodynamics applications which are encountered in a wide class of holonomic-scleronomic problems. The formulations include the classical Newtonian mechanics framework with vector formalism, and new scalar formalisms with descriptive functions such as the Lagrangian, the Hamiltonian, and the Total Mechanical Energy to readily enable numerical discretizations. The concepts emanating from the present developments and distinctly different fundamental principles inherently: (1) can independently be shown to yield the strong form of the governing mathematical model equations of motion that are continuous in space and/or time together with the natural boundary conditions; the various frameworks for the case of holonomic-scleronomic systems with the mentioned limitations are indeed all equivalent, (2) can explain naturally how the weak statement of the Bubnov-Galerkin weighted-residual form that is customarily employed for discretization with vector formalism arises for both space and time, and (3) can circumvent relying upon traditional practices of conducting numerical discretizations starting either from balance of linear momentum (Newton's second law) involving Cauchy's equations of motion (governing equations) arising from continuum mechanics or via (1) and (2) above if one chooses this option. The concepts instead provide new avenues for numerical space/time discretization for continuum-dynamical systems or time discretization for N-body systems, and consequently, they enable equivalences to be drawn from amongst the various frameworks under certain restrictions to provide a unified approach and viewpoint. In addition, for the time discretization, focusing attention upon the class of Linear Multi Step (LMS) methods which are the most popular in research and commercial software, we particularly describe from a unified viewpoint, new avenues of discretization of the equations of motion via a new Total Energy framework. The resulting developments lead to improved phyical insight, inherit computationally attractive features for developing algorithms by design, and new and optimal algorithm designs, while recovering most of the developments that currently exist from traditional and/or classical practices.},

Such difficulties can be avoided by the staggered implicit-implicit algorithm and the direct a method which were introduced by Huang et al. (2004). Several numerical examples for surface step loadings were given to demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods. Since the numerical examples for the step loadings are not typical for dynamic problems, which usually show the relatively strong oscillation nature of dynamic behaviors. Due to the necessity to show the effectiveness of the proposed stabilization techniques for cyclic loading problems, two numerical examples regarding saturated soils subject to a surface cyclic loading are presented in this paper. Discussion on uniform and non-uniform mesh configuration is also given.},

  isbn = {84-87867-71-5},
  abstract = {The accurate prediction of the behaviour of geostructures is based on the strong coupling between the pore fluid and the solid skeleton. If the relative acceleration of the fluid phase to the skeleton is neglected, the equations describing the problem can be written in terms of skeleton displacements ( or velocities) and pore pressures. This mixed problem is similar to others found in solid and fluid dynamics. In the limit case of zero permeability and incompressibility of the fluid phase, the restrictions on the shape functions used to approximate displacements and pressures imposed by Babuska-Brezzi conditions or the Zienkiewicz-Taylor patch test hold. As a consequence, it is not possible to use directly elements with the same order of interpolation for the field variables. This paper proposes two alternative methods allowing us to circumvent the BE restrictions in the incompressibility limit, making it possible to use elements with the same order of interpolation. The first consists on introducing the divergence of the momentum equation of the mixture as an stabilization term, the second is a generalization of the two step-projection method introduced by Chorin for fluid dynamics problems.},

  title = {On Application of Two Superconvergent Recovery Procedures to Plate Problems},
  volume = {61},
  issn = {0029-5981},
  doi = {10/fr4p2r},
  abstract = {In this paper a study is performed on application of two recovery methods, i.e. superconvergent patch recovery (SPR) and the recovery by equilibrium of patches (REP), to plate problems. The two recovery methods have been recognized to give similar results in adaptive solutions of two dimensional stress problems. While the former applies a least square fit over a set of values at the so called superconvergent points, the latter does not need any knowledge of such points and thus has a wider application especially in non-linear problems. The formulation of REP is extended to Reissner-Mindlin plate problems. The convergence rates of the recovered fields of the gradients obtained from application of the two methods are compared using series of regular triangular and rectangular meshes for thick and thin plate solution cases. Assumed strain formulation based elements, i.e. the elements formulated by mixed interpolation of tensorial components, as well as conventional from of elements based on selective integration schemes are employed for the study. In order to investigate the possibility of any improvement in the results by adding equilibrium constraints to SPR, as some authors suggest for simple two-dimensional problems, some weighted forms of such conditions are designed and added to the formulation. Comprehensive study has been given first by varying the weight terms to obtain the best enhanced results and then using the optimal values to investigate the effects of the constraints on the rate of convergence. It is observed that despite of the cost of this approach, due to the coupling of the gradient terms, no significant improvement is achieved. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Dynamic analysis of J'(2) solids typically involves a huge number of degrees of freedom. Therefore, use of low cost elements such as linear triangles and tetrahedrals, is almost a requisite. However, the accuracy of these elements greatly deteriorates due to the incompressible behaviour of the material encountered in this type of problems. Besides, using mixed velocity-pressure formulations is precluded for these elements by the Babuska-Brezzi condition unless especial stabilization techniques are incorporated. This paper presents a stabilization technique allowing equal order of interpolation based on the operator splitting formulation used in the field of Fluid Dynamics with strong emphasis in the adequate treatment of the boundary conditions. The paper also describes its application to the solution of strain localization problems in J'(2) rate dependent materials. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Computational Mechanics or Computational Applied Science is today the base on which most of the achievements of engineering and physics are built. Its concern is the solution of complex mathematical theories in numerical terms, without which the translation of these into practical artifacts would be impossible. Indeed, by providing such quantitative measures it enhances the understanding of the physical phenomena and stimulates further development of theory and physical experiment. Most of the theory underlying physical phenomena is cast in terms of, often involved, differential equations for which closed forms of solution are seldom possible. Numerical approximation or discretization processes are necessary for quantitative solution. Here the first steps were taken at the start of this century by the pioneering work of Richardson introducing finite difference approximations. The invention of relaxation methods by Southwell during the Second World War allowed many practical solutions to be achieved. However, it was the advent of the electronic digital computer that marked the turning point in Computational Mechanics. The dramatic escalation of the power of these machines, which still continues today, allowed the development of the field of Computational Mechanics as we know it. It is through this computer power that such methods of approximations as finite elements, finite differences, boundary solutions and spectral processes became a practical reality, though each was anticipated in the pre computer area. It is not surprising therefore, that the mathematical foundations and the full development of such methods have been accomplished only relatively recently. Today we see the field of activity subdivided between those specializing in the development of the various computational approximation processes and those seeking optimal numerical solutions for their particular field of application. It is the objective of this Congress and indeed of the International Association of Computational Mechanics to provide a forum at which an interdisciplinary exchange of information can take place between the various sections and disciplines of the whole field. Indeed, this is the way progress can best be achieved. Recent history indicates that substantial advances are as frequently made due to a method seeking a new application as through a problem requiring a solution. In recent history we have seen on occasion a liaison of a particular computational approximation method to a field of application occurring through historical accident. Here the intimate association of the finite method and the field of SOLID MECHANICS (CSM or Computational Solid Mechanics) and that of the finite differences with FLUID DYNAMICS (CDF or Computational Fluid Dynamics) can be observed as classical examples. Today the advent of new application fields and a better understanding of the approximation theory are helping to break down the barriers and ensure a more rational matching of objectives and methods. We shall illustrate the lecture with examples of such recent progress and state some possibilities as yet unexplored. Indeed, we are sure that the Congress will achieve in much more detail the same aims. This presentation stresses the essential unity of the subject and discuss some areas where progress and research are currently active. Two of such, adaptive error controlled analysis and treatment of hyperbolic (fluid) problems, are singled out due to their wide applications.},

  abstract = {This paper presents some advances of finite element explicit formulation for simulation of metal forming processes. Because of their computational efficiency, finite element programs based on the explicit dynamic formulation proved to be a very attractive tool for the simulation of metal forming processes. The use of explicit programs in the sheet forming simulation is quite common, the possibilities of these codes in bulk forming simulation in our opinion are still not exploited sufficiently. In our paper, we will consider aspects of bulk forming simulation. We will present new formulations and algorithms developed for bulk metal forming within the explicit formulation. An extension of a finite element code for the thermomechanical coupled analysis is discussed. A new thermomechanical constitutive model developed by the authors and implemented in the program is presented. A new formulation based on the so-called split algorithm allows us to use linear triangular and tetrahedral elements in the analysis of large plastic deformations characteristic to forming processes. Linear triangles and tetrahedra have many advantages over quadrilateral and hexahedral elements. Linear triangles and tetrahedra based on the standard formulations exhibit volumetric locking and are not suitable for large plastic strain simulation. The new formulation allows to overcome this difficulty. New formulations and algorithms have been implemented in the finite element code Stampack developed at the International Centre for Numerical Methods in Engineering in Barcelona. Numerical examples illustrate some of the possibilities of the finite element code developed and validate new algorithms. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The accurate prediction of the behaviour of geostructures is based on the strong coupling between the pore fluid and the solid skeleton. If the relative acceleration of the fluid phase to the skeleton is neglected, the equations describing the problem can be written in terms of skeleton displacements ( or velocities) and pore pressures. This mixed problem is similar to others found in solid and fluid dynamics. In the limit case of zero permeability and incompressibility of the fluid phase, the restrictions on the shape functions used to approximate displacements and pressures imposed by Babuslta-Brezzi conditions or the Zienkiewicz-Taylor patch test hold. As a consequence, it is not possible to use directly elements with the same order of interpolation for the field variables. This paper proposes two alternative methods allowing us to circumvent the BE restrictions in the incompressibility limit, making it possible to use elements with the same order of interpolation. The first consists on introducing the divergence of the momentum equation of the mixture as an stabilization term, the second is a generalization of the two step-projection method introduced by Chorin for fluid dynamics problems.},

  abstract = {The solution of problems in which coupling occurs between the displacement of the soil skeleton and the pore fluid pressure is fundamental in soil dynamics. The formulation requires that the interpolation functions for the displacement and pressure in the finite element discretization must satisfy the so-called Babuska-Brezzi stability criteria or the patch test in the limit of nearly incompressible Pore fluid and small permeability. The criteria are not fulfiled by elements with the same order of interpolation for both variables unless stabilization techniques are introduced. This paper summarizes the stabilization techniques that have been proposed in the literature to overcome volumetric locking for the incompressible or nearly incompressible soil dynamic behaviours. In particular, the staggered implicit-implicit algorithm (i.e. the fractional step method in an implicit form) and the direct alpha-method proposed by the first author and Zienkiewicz et at. are briefly reviewed. Attentions will be paid to the steady-state formulations resulted from both approaches. Based on the steady state formulations, the paper will then discuss the determination of the local stabilization parameters, with which a significant improvement for the obtained solutions of pore-pressure can be achieved. Further discussion on the limitations of the methods is also given. Finally, several numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.

Through consideration of standard C(0)-type expansion bases. as opposed to elementally orthogonal expansions, with the matrix formulation we are able to apply static condensation techniques to improve efficiency of the direct solver when high order expansions are adopted. The use of C(0)-type expansions also permits the direct enforcement of Dirichlet boundary conditions through a `lifting' approach where the LDG flux does not require further stabilization. In our construction we also adopt a formulation of the continuous DG fluxes that permits a more general interpretation of their numerical implementation. In particular it allows us to determine the conditions under which the LDG method provides a near local stencil. Finally a Study of the conditioning and the size of the null space of the matrix systems resulting from the DG discretization of the elliptic problem is undertaken.

  issn = {0029-5981},
  doi = {10/d6226d},
  abstract = {This paper introduces a new recovery-type error estimator ensuring local equilibrium and yielding a guaranteed upper bound of the error. The upper bound property requires the recovered solution to be both statically equilibrated and continuous. The equilibrium is obtained locally (patch-by-patch) and the continuity is enforced by a postprocessing based on the partition of the unity concept. This postprocess is expected to preserve the features of the locally equilibrated stress field. Nevertheless, the postprocess phase modifies the equilibrium, which is no longer exactly fulfilled. A new methodology is introduced that yields upper bound estimates by taking into account this lack of equilibrium. This requires computing the L-2 norm of the error or relating it with the energy norm. The guaranteed upper bounds are obtained by using a pessimistic bound of the error L-2 norm, derived from an eigenvalue problem. Nevertheless, these bounds are not sharp. An additional strategy based on a more accurate assessment of the error L-2 norm is introduced, providing sharp estimates, which are practical upper bounds as it is demonstrated in the numerical tests.

The method is described and applied to the solution of a scalar convection-diffusion problem and the problem of elasticity at the incompressible or quasi-incompressible limit. The formulation permits the use of equal interpolation for displacements and pressure on linear triangles and tetrahedra as well as any low order element type. To add additional stability in the solution, pressure gradient corrections are introduced as suggested from developments of sub-scale methods.

  abstract = {The accurate prediction of the behaviour of geostructures is based on the strong coupling between the pore fluid and the solid skeleton. If the relative acceleration of the fluid phase relative to the skeleton is neglected, the equations describing the problem can be written in terms of skeleton displacements (or velocities) and pore pressures. This mixed problem is similar to others found in solid and fluid dynamics. In the limit case of zero permeability and incompressibility of the fluid phase, the restrictions on the shape functions used to approximate displacements and pressures imposed by Babuska-Brezzi conditions or the Zienkiewicz-Taylor patch test hold. As a consequence, it is not possible to use directly elements with the same order of interpolation for the field variables. This paper proposes a generalization of the fractional-step method introduced by Chorin for fluid dynamics problems, which allows to circumvent BE restrictions in the incompressibility limit, thus making it possible to use elements with the same order of interpolation.

The algorithm has been previously applied to compressible fluid dynamics problems to capture discontinuities such as shocks.

Results show that the methods based on the second gradient of pressure give better performance in all situations. For instance, the method constructed from the nodal pressure values and consistent and lumped mass matrices is an excellent choice for inviscid problems. The method based on L-2 projection is better than any other method in viscous flow computations. The residual based anisotropic method gives excellent performance in the supersonic range and gives better results in the hypersonic regime if a small amount of residual smoothing is used.

  issn = {0045-7949},
  doi = {10/bcvt8r},
  abstract = {Finite elements used for analysis of plastic failure must admit near incompressible behaviour for meaningful results whenever the plastic flow rule is isochoric. Most of the classical elements based on displacement formulations present problems to a greater or lesser extent when obtaining limit loads and failure mechanisms. Mixed pressure-displacement formulations are a suitable alternative, but not every combination of interpolation functions for pressures and displacements is allowed, since they have to satisfy Babuska-Brezzi conditions or pass a patch test for convergence. This excludes interpolations of the same order for both fields unless special techniques are used. This paper describes the formulation of mixed displacement-pressure elements with the same order of interpolation, and presents application to elastic and contained viscoplastic failure problems. It is shown how such different elements, like the T3P3 (linear displacements and pressures triangle) or the T6P6 (quadratic triangle in both variables), avoid volumetric locking and circumvent above mentioned restrictions. Indeed the formulation allows arbitrary interpolations as all restrictions are removed. However, the proposed formulation does not improve other aspects of element behaviour such as bending, and, therefore, the linear triangle is not recommended. Finally, performance of the quadratic T6P6 triangle is assessed using boundary value problems for which analytical solutions are available. Robustness against distortion is checked, and a good overall performance of this element is found. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

  abstract = {Abstract When a cubic function is interpolated between the prescribed initial displacement and velocity and the exact displacement and velocity at the end of a time step for a single degree of freedom system, the error, or residual, in the governing equation is zero at a number of times. It is shown that for a general undamped system, in the limit as the time step approaches zero these times correspond to Gauss points. This observation is verified by considering a general collocation procedure in which the displacement in any time step is approximated as a cubic function of time, with two coefficients chosen to satisfy the displacement and velocity at the beginning of the time step with the other two coefficients being chosen to satisfy the governing differential equation at any two times. It is shown that optimum accuracy is obtained if these points are the Gauss points. Detailed expressions are then presented for this particular case, and stability of the algorithm is investigated showing that the procedure is conditionally stable. For time steps which are a small proportion of the least period of vibration of the structure, the algorithm is considered to be the most accurate possible procedure based on cubic approximation of the displacement.},

Second, in its variational form, it offers physical insight into the so-called ``trailing terms'' of Hamilton's law. Third, numerical applications (i.e., finite elements in time) can be proven to be convergent under correct application of the bilinear formulation, whereas they can be demonstrated to diverge for specific problems under Hamilton's law. Fourth, the bilinear formulation offers automatic convergence of the ``natural'' velocity end conditions; while these must be constrained in present applications of Hamilton's law. Fifth, the bilinear formulation can be implemented in terms of a Larange multiplier that gives an order of magnitude improvement in the convergence of velocity. This implies that, in this form, the method is a hybrid finite-element approach.},

  abstract = {Blast loading is often described by means of high order functions, and step-by-step time integration algorithms are commonly used to evaluate the numerical solutions. The time step size for the Newmark method has to be very small in order to integrate the high order loading accurately. Recently, a complex time step formulation has been proposed to construct unconditionally stable higher order accurate time step integration algorithms with controllable numerical dissipation where loading with high order variation can be tackled without difficulties. The responses at the end of a time step are obtained by linearly combining the responses at various complex sub-step locations with different weighting factors. In this paper, the complex time step method is extended to evaluate the responses within a time step. The required weighting factors anywhere within a time step can be worked out systematically. Besides, there are some locations within a time step with one order higher in accuracy. A procedure is also proposed to evaluate the modified excitation at various complex sub-step locations. To verify the complex time step method, a single-degree-of freedom system subject to blast loading described by a fourth order polynomial is considered in detail. A multi-degree-of-freedom system is also analyzed. Excellent performance over the Newmark method is noted. It is possible to evaluate the responses due to blast loading by using just one time step.

For an algorithm that is (2n-1)th order accurate, the sub-step locations which may be complex, are shown to be the roots of an nth degree polynomial. The polynomial is given explicitly in terms of n and $\mu$. The weighting factors are then obtained by solving a system of n simultaneous equations.

It is shown that if the ultimate spectral radius is set between -1 and 1, the eigenvalues of the numerical amplification matrix are complex with magnitude less than or equal to unity. The algorithms are therefore unconditionally C-stable. When the ultimate spectral radius is set to 0 or 1, the algorithms are found to be equivalent to the first sub-diagonal and diagonal Pad{\'e} approximations, respectively. The present algorithms are more general as the numerical dissipation is controllable and are very suitable for parallel computers. The accuracy of the excitation responses is found to be enhanced by the present complex-time-step procedure. To maintain high-order accuracy, the excitation may need some modifications. \textcopyright{} 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

A full-scale specimen was tested under cyclic quasi-static loading. In the test, local buckling was first observed around the lap brace and through-brace intersection. A crack was then developed at the weld toe between the lap brace and the through brace, and the propagation of the crack led to the final failure of the joint. Indicators to assess the performance of the joints were evaluated within the context of seismic resistance. The energy analysis indicated that the local buckling at the intersection area was the main energy-dissipating mechanism. A comparison with an N-joint showed that the completely overlapped joint performed better under seismic loadings. An extensive finite-element analysis showed that increasing the lap brace diameter could improve the hysteresis performance of the joint while changing the gap size and the wall thickness of the through brace would have limited effects.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a precise time-step integration method for dynamic problems is presented. The second-order differential equations for dynamic problems are manipulated directly. A general damping matrix is considered. The transient responses are expressed in terms of the steady-state responses, the given initial conditions and the step-response and impulsive-response matrices. The steady-state responses for various types of excitations are readily obtainable. The computation of the step-response and impulsive-response matrices and their time derivatives are studied in this paper. A direct computation of these matrices using the Taylor series solutions is not efficient when the time-step size \&Delta;t is not small. In this paper, the recurrence formulae relating the response matrices at t = \&Delta;t to those at t = \&Delta;t/2 are constructed. A recursive procedure is proposed to evaluate these matrices at t = \&Delta;t from the matrices at t = \&Delta;t/2\textsuperscript{m}. The matrices at t = \&Delta;t/2\textsuperscript{m} are obtained from the Taylor series solutions. To improve the computational efficiency, the relations between the response matrices and their time derivatives are investigated. In addition, these matrices are expressed in terms of two symmetric matrices that can also be evaluated recursively. Besides, from the physical point of view, these matrices should be banded for small \&Delta;t. Both the stability and accuracy characteristics of the present algorithm are studied. Three numerical examples are used to illustrate the highly precise and stable algorithm.},

This paper presents a modified thick plate approach for the analysis of sandwich panels. To better appreciate the development of the proposed method, a brief review of the previous modelling techniques-i.e. closed-form solution, grillage analogy and the conventional finite element modelling-is given. At the present time, the closed-form solution is not amenable to analysis of panels with penetration or support conditions other than simply-supported all round. Response predictions using the grillage analogy necessitates a regular grid, and, for a panel with small penetration, a very fine grid is required. The advanced finite element package is ideal as a research tool but it requires significant computing time and memory. The proposed modified thick plate analysis reported here obviates the difficulties mentioned above. In this technique,it is assumed that the three layers of steel plates i.e. the top and bottom facing plates and the core, may be 'compacted' into an equivalent single layer of characteristics of the sandwich panel are preserved. Comparisons of deflections are presented for the different methods. Available experimental data are also provided to verify the proposed technique.},

To establish a reference point, a doubler plate-reinforced tubular T-joint was fabricated, instrumented, and tested to failure under axial compression brace loading. The structural behaviors were observed and analyzed. It was found that the ultimate capacity was greatly improved by the inclusion of the doubler plate. The experimental load-displacement curves were compared with the finite-element predictions and good agreement was obtained. The finite-element techniques were then verified and could be used to study the ultimate capacity.

The experimental data were fitted with the constitutive model to obtain the structure-related parameters, including the collagen amount and fiber orientation. Results showed that a bilinear strain energy function (SEF) with four parameters could fit the inflation data at an individual extension very well while a six-parameter model had to be used to capture the inflation behaviors at all three extensions simultaneously. It was found that the collagen distribution was axial preferred in both layers and the mucosa contained more collagen, which were in agreement with the findings through a pair of uniaxial tensile test in our previous study. The model was expected to be used for the prediction of stress distribution within the esophageal wall under the physiological state and provide some useful information in the clinical studies of the esophageal diseases.

  abstract = {In the harmonic differential quadrature method, truncated Fourier series comprising the trigonometric functions are used to approximate the solutions. The generalized Lagrange functions composed of trigonometric functions are constructed as interpolation functions so that the unknowns are the function values, rather than the Fourier coefficients. In the spirit of the differential quadrature method, the derivatives at a sampling grid point are expressed as weighted linear sums of function values at all the sampling grid points. It is shown that the corresponding weighting coefficients of higher order derivatives can be evaluated recursively and the general explicit formulae are given in this paper. The differential quadrature analog of the governing equations can then be established easily at the sampling grid points. For the periodic boundary value problems, the periodic boundary conditions are satisfied automatically and no other boundary conditions are required in general. It is also shown that the harmonic differential quadrature method is related to the trigonometric collocation method and the harmonic balance method. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the validity and efficiency of the present method. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.},

In relating the least-squares procedures to the weighted residual method, the weighting functions can be identified as the residuals obtained by substituting the trial functions into the governing equation. By using a different set of functions to construct the residual weighting functions, a more general `pseudo'-least-squares method is proposed here. Instead of having the weighting functions specified explicitly and the characteristics of the resultant algorithms investigated, the weighting parameter method is adopted. The required residual weighting functions can be reconstructed from the selected weighting parameters. The weighting parameters corresponding to the A-stable generalized Pad{\'e} approximations are presented in this paper. The order of accuracy is 4n-1 in general if n unknown variables are used in approximating the solutions. It is found that a direct application of the least-squares procedures to multi-degree-of-freedom systems may result in loss of accuracy. By studying the uncoupling conditions for the multi-degree-of-freedom systems, modified forms are suggested for various least-squares methods to maintain the accuracy and stability properties. A two-degree-of-freedom system is used to illustrate the accuracy of the standard, pseudo- and modified-least-squares procedures. Copyright \textcopyright{} 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

It is shown that the smoothness of geometric parametrizations central to computer-aided design can be exploited for regularizing integral operators to obtain high-order collocation methods involving superior approximation and numerical integration schemes. The regularization is applicable to both singular and hyper-singular integral equations, and as a result one can formulate the governing integral equations so that the corresponding linear algebraic equations are well-conditioned. It is demonstrated that the proposed approach allows one to compute accurate approximate solutions which optimally converge to the exact ones.},

An h-adaptive strategy, which does not require knowledge of the scaling constant appearing in the error estimator, is described. Numerical results for a two-dimensional model problem show that significant problem size reduction can be obtained through this adaptive approach. An algorithm is presented to compute the scaling constant, which leads to computable error estimates.

We then get down to business and describe our approach-the variational multiscale formulation of LES. Application is made to turbulent two-dimensional equilibrium and three-dimensional non-equilibrium Channel flows. Simple, constant-coefficient Smagorinsky-type eddy viscosities, without wall damping functions, are used to model the transfer of energy from small resolved scales to unresolved scales, an approach which is not viable within the traditional LES framework. Nevertheless, very good results are obtained.},

If the elements are oriented along the particle paths, the formulation is Lagrangian and if they are fixed in time, it is Eulerian. Consequently this formulation is analogous to the arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) technique. A novel mesh rezoning strategy is presented to orient the elements in time and adapt the fluid mesh to the changing spatial configuration.

The higher-continuity property of such functions is explored in nearly incompressible applications and shown to produce accurate and robust results. A new non-linear (F) over bar projection method, based on a modified minimum potential energy principle and inspired by the (B) over bar method is proposed for the large-deformation case. It leads to a symmetric formulation for which the consistent linearized operator for fully non-linear elasticity is derived and used in a Newton-Raphson iterative procedure. The performance of the methods is assessed on several numerical examples, and results obtained are shown to compare favorably with other published techniques. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

  doi = {10/btwv7r},
  abstract = {The patch test was introduced in the mid-1960s, first as a check of satisfactory performance for elements violating continuity requirements, and later simply as a necessary condition which all elements had to satisfy and which frequently checked simple programming errors. In its original farm the patch test simply verified that the minimum local consistency error was achievable and that the programming was correct. Later, it was established that the test could also be used to find the convergence order of any finite element type. While consistency is one of the necessary requirements for convergence the second is of course that of stability. In the original early work only displacement type, structural elements were involved and thus stability was ensured by rejecting elements which could farm mechanisms. In a 1986 reformulation of the patch test, this stability (or solvability) requirement was formalized to all element assemblies and the patch test extended to become a generally applicable sufficient and necessary condition for convergence of all element forms [1,2]. Although some misinterpretation of the patch test has occurred in literature [3,4], the authors believe that with certain restrictions on regularity of the problem dealt with, the satisfaction of. the patch rest is equivalent to the satisfaction of the more mathematical Babuska-Brezzi criteria [5,6]. In recent years another important use of the patch test has been found by Babuska and his coworkers [7-9]. This work tests the asymptotic effectivity of various error estimating procedures used with various element patterns.},

  abstract = {Geomaterials in general, and soils in particular, are highly nonlinear materials presenting a very strong coupling between solid skeleton and intersticial water. In the limit of zero compressibility of water and soil grains and zero permeability (which correspond to the classical `undrained' assumption of Soil Mechanics), the functions used to interpolate displacements and pressures must fulfill either the Babuska-Brezzi conditions or the much simpler patch test proposed by Zienkiewicz and Taylor. These requirements exclude the use of elements with equal order interpolation for pressures and displacements, for which spurious oscillations may appear. The simplest elements with continuous pressures which can be used in 2D are the quadratic triangle and quadrilateral with linear and bilinear pressures, respectively. The purpose of this paper is to present a stabilization technique allowing the use of both linear triangles for displacements and pressures (T3P3) and bilinear quadrilaterals (Q4P4). The proposed element will be applied to obtain limit loads and failure surfaces in simple boundary value problems for which analytical solutions exist. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science S.A.

Comparison between the gradient and curvature-based error indicators show that the former yields better performance in most situations. However, we found that the latter indicators predict better motion in the recirculatory and unstable regions, than the gradient-based method. Many test cases have been presented for both compressible and incompressible flow problems. In the later part of the paper, we suggest a simple way of combining the curvature/gradient indicators of different key variables and present an appropriate problem where it is applicable.

The first is the characteristic-based split (CBS). It combines the characteristic Galerkin method to deal with convection dominated flows with a classical splitting technique, which in some cases allows us to use equal velocity-pressure interpolations. The second approach is the Galerkin-least-squares (GLS) method, in which a least-squares form of the element residual is added to the basic Galerkin equations. It is shown that both formulations display similar stabilization mechanisms, provided the stabilization parameter of the GLS method is identified with the time step of the CBS approach. This identification can be understood from a formal Fourier analysis of the linearized problem. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.},

Although facilities for local mesh elongation have been incorporated into earlier codes in generating unstructured meshes, these do not permit the use of very high stretch ratios required for the analysis of such problems as boundary layers. Here the use of locally introduced structured meshes has been practised involving much manual interaction and loss of error control. In the paper we present a procedure which achieves the combination of such locally structured meshes with a general unstructured mesh generator in an automatic and fully adaptive manner.

  abstract = {A new algorithm for the solution of the shallow water equations is introduced. The formulation is founded on a suitable operator-splitting procedure for which a characteristic-based rational form of including balancing dissipation terms is achieved. In the semi-explicit form the method circumvents the requirement of a critical time step given in terms of the wave celerity, which is restrictive for the analysis of long-wave propagation in shallow waters. In this work the robustness of the algorithm is illustrated for transient shallow water problems and for some supercritical flows, where the choice of an algorithm with optimal diffusion properties is manifest.},

  issn = {0029-5981},
  doi = {10/ddsnpx},
  abstract = {Many finite elements exhibit the so-called `volumetric locking' in the analysis of incompressible or quasi-incompressible problems. In this paper, a new approach is taken to overcome this undesirable effect. The starting point is a new setting of the governing differential equations using a finite calculus (FIC) formulation. The basis of the FIC method is the satisfaction of the standard equations for balance of momentum (equilibrium of forces) and mass conservation in a domain of finite size and retaining higher order terms in the Taylor expansions used to express the different terms of the differential equations over the balance domain. The modified differential equations contain additional terms which introduce the necessary stability in the equations to overcome the volumetric locking problem. The FIC approach has been successfully used for deriving stabilized finite element and meshless methods for a wide range of advective-diffusive and fluid flow problems. The same ideas are applied in this paper to derive a stabilized formulation for static and dynamic finite element analysis of incompressible solids using linear triangles and tetrahedra. Examples of application of the new stabilized formulation to linear static problems as well as to the semi-implicit and explicit 2D and 3D non-linear transient dynamic analysis of an impact problem and a bulk forming process are presented.

Because it does not need to identify super-convergent points, it is applicable for any form of element in which these points are not defined. The formulation is very simple and is based on equilibrating the recovered stresses, in the patch, in the same way that the standard FEM does. This procedure leads to a weak form of equilibrium equations of new stresses on the patch and consequently to answers satisfying the discrete equilibrium conditions. The formulation is consistent with nonlinear formulations which iteratively equilibrate the problem. Therefore, this method can be used to project the Gauss points values to nodal points, with minimum disturbance of the global equilibrium.},

  doi = {10/fqnwqw},
  abstract = {In this paper we consider some particular aspects related to the semi-implicit version of a fractional step finite element method for compressible flows that we have developed recently. The first is the imposition of boundary conditions, We show that no boundary conditions at all need to be imposed in the first step where an intermediate momentum is computed. This allows us to impose the real boundary conditions for the pressure, a point that turns out to be very important for compressible flows. The main difficulty of the semi-implicit form of the scheme arises in the solution of the continuity equation, since it involves both the density and the pressure. These two variables can be related through the equation of state, which in turn introduces the temperature as a variable in many cases. We discuss here the choice of variables (pressure or density) and some strategies to solve the continuity equation. The final point that we study is the behaviour of the scheme in the incompressible limit. It is shown that the method has an inherent pressure dissipation that allows us to reach this limit without having to satisfy the classical compatibility conditions for the interpolation of the velocity and the pressure.

First, only quadrilateral or hexahedral linear elements can be used thus limiting the possibilities of adaptive refinement and adaptive meshing. Second, even with the use of such elements, special devices such as reduced integration must be introduced to avoid locking and reduce costs. These necessitate complex hour glass control, mending-type procedures. The main difficulties are those due to the need of treatment of (almost) incompressible deformation modes. Recently, similar difficulties have been overcome in the context of fluid dynamics(4,5) and soil dynamics(18-20) and we show here how the processes introduced there can be adopted effectively to the present problem, thus allowing an almost unrestricted choice of element interpolations.

  abstract = {In 1995 the two senior authors of the present paper introduced a new algorithm designed to replace the Taylor-Galerkin (or Lax-Wendroff) methods, used by them so far in the solution of compressible flow problems. The new algorithm was applicable to a wide variety of situations, including fully incompressible flows and shallow water equations, as well as supersonic and hypersonic situations, and has proved to be always at least as accurate as other algorithms currently used. The algorithm is based on the solution of conservation equations of fluid mechanics to avoid any possibility of spurious solutions that may otherwise result. The main aspect of the procedure is to split the equations into two parts, (I) a part that is a set of simple scalar equations of convective-diffusion type for which it is well known that the characteristic Galerkin procedure yields an optimal solution; and (2) the part where the equations are self-adjoint and therefore discretized optimally by the Galerkin procedure. It is possible to solve both the first and second parts of the system explicitly, retaining there the time step limitations of the Taylor-Galerkin procedure. But it is also possible to use semi-implicit processes where in the first part we use a much bigger time step generally governed by the Peclet number of the system while the second part is solved implicitly and is unconditionally stable. It turns out that the characteristic-based-split (CBS) process allows equal interpolation to be used for all system variables without difficulties when the incompressible or nearly incompressible stage is reached. It is hoped that the paper will help to make the algorithm more widely available and understood by the profession and that its advantages can be widely realised.

In this paper, a general recovery technique is developed for determining the derivatives (stresses) of the finite element solutions at nodes. The implementation of the recovery technique is simple and cost effective. The technique has been tested for a group of widely used linear, quadratic and cubic elements for both one and two dimensional problems. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the recovered nodal values of the derivatives with linear and cubic elements are superconvergent. One order higher accuracy is achieved by the procedure with linear and cubic elements but two order higher accuracy is achieved for the derivatives with quadratic elements. In particular, an 0(h4) convergence of the nodal values of the derivatives for a quadratic triangular element is reported for the first time. The performance of the proposed technique is compared with the widely used smoothing procedure of global L2 projection and other methods. It is found that the derivatives recovered at interelement nodes, by using L2 projection, are also superconvergent for linear elements but not for quadratic elements. Numerical experiments on the convergence of the recovered solutions in the energy norm are also presented. Higher rates of convergence are again observed. The results presented in this part of the paper indicate clearly that a new, powerful and economical process is now available which should supersede the currently used post-processing procedures applied in most codes.},

Therefore, it is superior to the isoparametric approach because of its obvious physical meaning and accuracy; it has successfully been applied to the isotropic elasticity problem. In this paper, the formulation of rational finite elements for plane orthotropic elasticity problems is deduced. This method is formulated directly in the physical domain with full consideration of the requirements of the patch test. Based on the number of element nodes and the interpolation functions, different approaches are applied with complete polynomial interpolation functions. Then, two special stiffness matrixes of elements with four and five nodes are deduced as a representative application. In addition, some typical numerical examples are considered to evaluate the performance of the elements. The numerical results demonstrate that the present method has a high level of accuracy and is an effective technique for solving plane orthotropic elasticity problems.},

The nonlinear optimal problem with state-control constraints is firstly transcribed into a sequence of constraint linear quadratic (LQ) optimal control problems. Then, the symplectic discretization form is applied to the constrained LQ optimal control problem and then the explicit linear complementary problem can be derived. Finally, the solutions of nonlinear constrained optimal control problems can be obtained by employing a standard linear complementary solver. Because the proposed numerical method is symplectic preserved and the state-control constraints are imposed at the discrete points of time interval, the high accuracy and high efficiency numerical solutions can be obtained with large time interval and small iteration times. Meanwhile, the state-control constraints and the terminal states constraints can be satisfied exactly for given accuracy. Numerical simulations show than various types of optimal control problems are investigated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approximation scheme. The method is robust, easy to implement and provides very accurate results. (C) 2015 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The author considers discretization systems which preserve the characteristic properties and inner symmetries of the original continuous systems. The centered Euler scheme, its generalizations, and staggered explicit schemes for separable Hamiltonians appear to have the property that the transition from one time step to the next time step is canonical, and the invariant integrals of the original system remain invariant under this transition. Next, the author considers generating functions and the problem of the construction of canonical difference schemes on the basis of these functions.

A general framework is proposed in the following pages, where the configuration space and the phase space forms of Hamilton's Law provide the general statements of the problem of motion. Within this framework, different families of integration algorithms are derived, according to different interpretations of the boundary terms. The bi-discontinuous form is obtained as the consequence of a consistent impulsive formulation of dynamics, while the discontinuous Galerkin form is obtained when the boundary terms at the end of the time interval are appropriately approximated.},

This is especially true in the situation where (i) f(t,y) and/or f'(t,y) are quickly varying in t and/or y and (ii) a low degree of accuracy is required. Such difficulties may also arise when diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta methods (DlRKM's) are used.

An error estimation technique for the 2-stage MDlRKM's is proposed.

  title = {Stability of {{Runge}}-{{Kutta}} Methods for Stiff Nonlinear Differential Equations},
  volume = {47},
  abstract = {ABSTRACT In the analysis of numerical schemes for ordinary differential equations one has traditionally assumed that the differential system is Lipschitz continuous. However, for stiff problems it is more appropriate to assume that the system satisfies some one sided Lipschitz condition. Based on this assumption G. Dahlquist introduced in 1975 the concept of G- stability for linear multistep methods. In the same year, J. Butcher published the corresponding definition of B-stability for Runge-Kutta schemes. The book gives a detailed and thorough report of the development of the nonlinear stability analysis of Runge-Kutta schemes from Butcher鈥檚 B-stability definition up to Hairer and T眉rke鈥檚 equivalence of A- stability and B-stability. The book is lucidly written. The authors have succeeded almost completely to melt the different research papers to a uniform theory. However, on some occasions one would have liked a weeding out of some unimportant concepts such as for example AN-stability. The authors have stayed consequently within the title of the book. Hence, the beautiful rooted trees theory for the order conditions has been omitted while the linear absolute stability theory is kept to its bare minimum. This makes the book to specialized for a general course on Runge-Kutta schemes. However, it is definitely well suited for a special course or seminar on this somewhat limited topic. It is a very good book for any researcher in this field since it collects practically all relevant work done since 1975 in one volume. The subject is devided into ten chapters. In the first two introductory chapters the phenomena of stiffness are explained and several interesting examples are given. The concepts of absolute stability for the linear equation, contractivity and the one- sided Lipschitz condition are introduced and some results and examples are given for illustration. In addition, the logarithmic norm is treated. In chapter 3 the Runge-Kutta schemes are introduced along with the simplifying order conditions. The methods based on high order quadrature and some of their linear stability properties are given. Then results concerning the order of diagonally- and singly-implicit methods are given. The beautiful order conditions using the W-transform of Hairer and Wanner are used to treat Runge-Kutta schemes with positive weights. In Chapter 4 relations between the different stability concepts such as B-, BN-, A-, AN-stability and algebraic stability are given. To do this the reducibility of a scheme is introduced. The chapter ends with a more detailed investigation on algebraically stable schemes. Chapter 5 deals with the solution of the nonlinear equation which one has to solve at each integration step if one uses implicit schemes. Existence and uniqueness of the solution is investigated. In addition, using BSI- stability, of Frank, Schneid and Ueberhuber the error of the numerical solution is bounded by internal perturbations. Then many known implicit schemes are investigated with respect to their BSI-stability. The chapter ends with some generalizations of B-stability and implementation consideration for implicit Runge-Kutta methods. In the short chapter 6 contractivity of explicit schemes is treated. In chapter 7 B-consistency and B-convergence are introduced to obtain realistic error bounds for the numerical solution in the transient phase of a stiff problem. Then sufficient conditions for these concepts are given. While in the next chapter D-stability is introduced, chapter 10 investigates Runge-Kutta Rosenbrock methods and their stability properties. In the last chapter applications to partial differential equations are considered. In particular a pseudo-linear parabolic problem, the linear advection equation, diffusion-convection problems and the shallow water equations are treated.},

We present exploratory results for a class of variable-step, three-step, three-stage, explicit Nordsieck multivalue methods of order six. The methods use the order six formula to advance approximations to the solution and scaled first derivatives from the previous three steps. An embedded order five formula is used to form the local error estimate. The methods have stage order five which enables us to construct a local continuous extension of order five without performing extra derivative evaluations. Our numerical results show, despite the exploratory nature of our work, that the new methods are competitive with (5,6) explicit Runge-Kutta pairs.

  abstract = {The use of the recently discovered DIMSIM (Diagonally IMplicit Multi-Step Integration Method) class of general linear methods for the numerical solution of ordinary differential equations has been investigated with the purpose of developing software based on these methods. DIMSIMs have high stage order and provide a Nordsieck vector at each integration step with essentially no additional computational cost. The implementation advantages of these features were extensively explored. Simplified procedures are developed for deriving parameters used in the calculation of the Nordsieck vector, interpolation, and error estimation. A continuous interpolant based on the Nordsieck vector and requiring no additional function evaluations has been developed that exists for all DIMSIMs. An automatic starting procedure has been developed and successfully tested. Second and fifth order adaptive explicit solvers DIMEX2 and DIMEX5 were developed in FORTRAN 77 and were competitive in testing against established codes on DETEST. A FASAL (First Approximately Same As Last) implementation approach was developed which takes advantage of high stage order to eliminate one internal stage calculation per step. It is shown that FASAL implementations require separate stability analyses. New Richardson and companion method approaches to error estimation are proposed that also use high stage order and require essentially no additional computational cost. Heuristic estimates for stiff problems for both second and fifth order implicit methods were developed based on a Richardson approach. Alternative predictor-corrector DIMSIM implementations were analyzed. Finally, prototype second and fifth order adaptive stiff solvers were developed and tested successfully.

The method, which is first-order accurate in the time step, is shown to converge to an exact solution of the equations. By adequately splitting the viscous term, it allows the enforcement of full Dirichlet boundary conditions on the velocity in all substeps of the scheme, unlike standard projection methods. The consideration of this method was actually motivated by the study of a well-known predictor-multicorrector algorithm, when this is applied to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. A new derivation of the algorithm in a general setting is provided, showing in what sense it can also be understood as a fractional-step method; this justifies, in particular, why the original boundary conditions of the problem can be enforced in this algorithm. Two different finite element interpolations are considered for the space discretization, and numerical results obtained with them for standard benchmark cases are presented.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT The significance of particular computational algorithm by design within the context of a generalized single step single solve order preserving computational framework encompassing the class of LMS methods which directly deals with index 3 differential algebraic equations (DAE's) that naturally arise in multi-body dynamics systems with constraints is presented. For deriving the mathematical model for constraint dynamical systems such as multi-body dynamics, the the resulting governing equations naturally arise as index 3 DAE systems involving a position level constraint. there exist numerous computational difficulties with solving the index 3 systems and most existing techniques either loose their expected order of accuracy or fail to complete the analysis, and consequently index reduction methods are employed which in turn cause other problems such as drift in solutions. The present computational framework of a family of algorithms for index 3 DAE systems described here, have been derived from the GSSSS family of algorithms for linear dynamical non-constraint systems, based on the algorithmic time level consistency theorem. The algorithmic framework is capable of providing stable, robust, and accurate integration of index 3 DAE's directly for both rigid and rigid/flexible multi-body dynamics applications. A challenging numerical example is employed and numerical illustrations demonstrate the significance and importance of the presented technique, namely a novel midpoint rule formulation with midpoint based acceleration in resolving the numerical difficulties in contrast to the classical midpoint rule with endpoint acceleration and the classical Newmark method.},

The parallel implementation criteria that influence the efficiency of an algorithm include the amount of communication, communication routing, and load balancing. To provide simplicity, high level of accuracy, and to retain the generality of the finite element implementation for both linear and non-linear transient explicit problems on a data parallel computer which permit optimum amount of communications, we implemented the present self-starting dynamic formulations (in comparison to the traditional approaches) based on nodal displacements, nodal velocities, and elemental stresses on the CM-5. Data parallel language CMFortran is employed with virtual processor constructs and with:SERIAL and:PARALLEL layout directives for arrays. The communications via the present approach involve only one gather operation (extraction of element nodal displacements or velocities from global displacement vector) and one scatter operation (dispersion of element forces onto global force vector) for each time step. These gather and scatter operations are implemented using the Connection Machine Scientific Software Library communication primitives for both structured and unstructured finite element meshes. The implementation aspects of the present self-starting formulations for linear and elastoplastic applications on serial and data parallel machines are discussed. Numerical test models for linear and non-linear one-dimensional applications and a two-dimensional unstructured finite element mesh are then illustrated and their performance studies are discussed.},

The resulting and so-called generalized integration operators encompass a wide vriety of new computational algorithms which have not been explored to-date including the recovery of various existing algorithms, and primitive building blocks are identified which constitute the overall unified framework.

A novel explicit primal-dual technique is proposed here to overcome the problems such as instabilities, order reduction in convergence and constraint preserving associated with the DAE index 3 system. Instead of simultaneously solving the generalized coordinates and the Lagrange multipliers, the differential equations and algebraic equations are specially treated thus solving the generalized coordinates separately from the Lagrange multipliers. The claims of the proposed technique are illustrated via numerical examples by employing explicit time integration operators in the conservation form. The overall developments demonstrate effective handling of the primal issues that fundamentally preserve the underlying properties under the umbrella of Linear Multistep methods.},

  title = {Total Energy Framework, Finite Elements, and Discretization via {{Hamilton}}'s Law of Varying Action},
  volume = {206},
  abstract = {Within the total energy framework which we introduce here for the first time (in contrast to Lagrangian or Hamiltonian mechanics framework), we provide an alternative and have developed in this paper a general numerical discretization for continuum-elastodynamics directly stemming from Hamilton's law of varying action (HLVA) involving a measurable built-in scalar function, namely, Total Energy $\backslash$([$\backslash$mathcalE$\backslash$left($\backslash$boldsymbolq,$\backslash$dot$\backslash$boldsymbolq$\backslash$right): TQ$\backslash$rightarrow $\backslash$mathbbR]$\backslash$) . The Total Energy we use herein for enabling the space discretization is defined as the kinetic energy plus the potential energy for N-body systems, and the kinetic energy plus the total potential energy for continuum-body systems. It thereby provides a direct measure and sound physical interpretation naturally, while enabling this framework to permit general numerical discretizations such as with finite elements. In the variational formulation proposed here, we place particular emphasis upon the notion that the scalar function which represents the autonomous total energy of the continuum/N-body dynamical systems can be a crucial mathematical function and physical quantity which is a constant of motion in conservative systems. In addition, we prove that the autonomous total energy possesses the three invariant properties and can be viewed as the so-called total energy version of Noether's theorem; therefore, the autonomous total energy has time/translational/rotational symmetries for the continuum/N-body dynamical systems. The proposed concepts directly emanating from HLVA inherently involving the scalar function, namely, total energy: (i) can be shown to yield the same governing mathematical model equations of motion that are continuous in space and time together with the natural boundary conditions just as Hamilton's principle (HP) is routinely used to derive such equations, but without obvious inconsistency via such a principle as explained in the paper; (ii) explain naturally the Bubnov\textendash{}Galerkin weighted-residual form that is customarily employed for discretization for both space and time, and alternately, (iii) circumvent relying on traditional practices of conducting numerical discretizations starting either from the balance of linear momentum (Newton's second law) involving Cauchy's equations of motion (governing equations) arising from continuum mechanics or via (i) and (ii) above if one chooses this option, and instead provides new avenues of discretization for continuum-dynamical systems. The present developments naturally embody the weak form in space and time that can be described by a discrete Total Energy Differential Operator (TEDO). Thereby, a novel yet simple, space-discrete Total Energy formulation proposed here only needs to employ the discrete TEDO which provides new avenues and directly yields the semi-discrete ordinary differential equations in time which can be readily shown to preserve the same physical attributes as the continuous systems for continuum-dynamical applications unlike traditional practices. The modeling of complicated structural dynamical systems such as Euler-Bernoulli beams and Reissner\textendash{}Mindlin plates is particularly shown here for illustration.},

  abstract = {Of general interest here is the time dimension aspect wherein discretized operators in time may be continuous or discontinuous; and of particular interest and focus here is the design of time discretized operators in the context of discontinuous state-phase for computational dynamics applications. Based on a generalized bi-discontinuous time weighted residual formulation, the design leading to a new unified set of hierarchical energy conserving and energy dissipating time discretized operators are developed for the first time that are fundamentally useful for time adaptive computations for dynamic problems. Unlike time discontinuous Galerkin approaches, the design is based upon a time discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin-like approach employing an asymptotic series type approximations for the state variables involving derivatives at the beginning of the time step. As a consequence, this enables to design methods that have spectral properties corresponding to the diagonal, first sub-diagonal and second sub-diagonal Pad{\'e} entries. Thus, $\backslash$emph A-stable schemes of order\$2q\$, $\backslash$emph L-stable schemes of order\$2q-1\$ and\$2q-2\$ are obtained. The spectral equivalent algorithms to the diagonal Pad{\'e} entry are energy conserving algorithms. The spectral equivalent algorithms to the first and second sub-diagonal Pad{\'e} entries are energy dissipating algorithms with the property of asymptotic annihilation of the high frequency response. Additionally, these time operators naturally inherit a hierarchical structure that are extremely useful for time adaptive computations. Moreover, since Pad{\'e} entries have the lowest relative error the developed schemes are optimal in terms of order of accuracy in time, dissipation, dispersion and zero-order displacement and velocity overshoot characteristics.},

  abstract = {Conventional approaches for computational structural dynamics (CSD) relevant to time-integration methods involve first employing the classical Galerkin formulations for the spatial discretization to yield a set of ordinary differential equations in time and then employing finite difference approximations for deriving the appropriate step-by-step algorithms. And, almost all of the widely advocated (existing) step-by-step schemes for structural dynamics require an initial acceleration vector to be specified (evaluated) in addition to displacement and velocity vectors for starting the schemes. Unlike the above, in this paper we introduce new representations and architecture towards providing not only direct self-starting features with the elimination of acceleration computations but also for enhancing the computational architecture itself via several other inherent distinguishing characteristics. Thereby, a robust and effective methodology of computation is presented which is an extension of our previous efforts (see Tamma and Namburu3). In particular, to illustrate the basic concepts, in this paper we focus attention on the development of explicit time-integration formulations. The methodology involves expressing the governing dynamic equations of motion in conservation form, and firstly temporal discretization is accomplished in the spirit of Lax-Wendroff-type formulations. Therein, discretization in space is accomplished by introducing stress-based representations and employing the classical Galerkin scheme, and, quite naturally, we advocate employing finite elements as the principal computational tool because of its several inherent advantages. The stability and accuracy of the proposed formulations and the several added distinguishing features are briefly highlighted. Considerations on the effects of damping are additionally included and the introduction of general boundary conditions in a natural setting permits an effective generalized architecture for general applications.

Existing analytical approaches for modeling/analysis of such models involve complex mathematical formulations for obtaining closed-form solutions, while in certain numerical formulations the difficulties include severe oscillatory solution behavior (which often disguises the true response) in the vicinity of the thermal disturbances, which propagate with finite velocities. In view of these factors, the alpha method is evaluated to assess the control of the amount of numerical dissipation for predicting the transient propagating thermal disturbances. Numerical test models are presented, and pertinent conclusions are drawn for the mixed-time integration simulation of hyperbolic heat conduction models involving non-Fourier effects.},

Attention is focused on providing a brief overview and an indepth evaluation of the developments, methodology, computational issues and implementation aspects for practical problems. Different from the way we have been looking at the developments encompassing existing direct time-integration type methods and mode superposition techniques, the proposed methodology capitalizes on the computational attributes of both and thereby offers new perspectives and several attractive favourable features in terms of stability and accuracy, storage, and computational costs for a wide variety of inertial dynamic problems. Recently, the authors have shown the theoretical developments via the VIP methodology for transient structural problems and for transient thermal problems. The purpose of the present paper is to summarize the theoretical developments, improve upon the computational/implementation aspects for general linear/non-linear dynamic structural problems, and demonstrate the pros and cons via numerous illustrative test cases. The theoretical analysis and results of several test cases show that the VIP methodology has improved accuracy/stability characteristics and computational advantages in comparison to the commonly advocated explicit and implicit methods such as the Newmark family. Overall, an analysis of the theoretical developments, algorithmic study, and the implementation and evaluation of the formulations strongly suggest the proposition that the VIP methodology is a viable alternative for general structural dynamic applications encountered in practical engineering problems.},

  volume = {7},
  abstract = {Via new perspectives, for the time dimension, the present exposition overviews new and recent advances describing a standardized formal theory towards the evolution, classification, characterization and generic design of time discretized operators for transient/dynamic applications. Of fundamental importance in the present exposition are the developments encompassing the evolution of time discretized operators leading to the theoretical design of computational algorithms and their subsequent classification and characterization. And, the overall developments are new and significantly different from the way traditional modal type and a wide variety of step-by-step time marching approaches which we are mostly familiar with have been developed and described in the research literature and in standard text books over the years. The theoretical ideas and basis towards the evolution of a generalized methodology and formulations emanate under the umbrella and framework and are explained via a generalized time weighted philosophy encompassing the semi-discretized equations pertinent to transient/dynamic systems. It is herein hypothesized that integral operators and the associated representations and a wide variety of the so-called integration operators pertain to and emanate from the same family, with the burden which is being carried by a virtual field or weighted time field specifically introduced for the time discretization is strictly enacted in a mathematically consistent manner so as to first permit obtaining the adjoint operator of the original semi-discretized equation system. Subsequently, the selection or burden carried by the virtual or weighted time fields originally introduced to facilitate the time discretization process determines the formal development and outcome of ``exact integral operators'', ``approximate integral operators'', including providing avenues leading to the design of new computational algorithms which have not been exploited and/or explored to-date and the recovery of most of the existing algorithms, and also bridging the relationships systematically leading to the evolution of a wide variety of ``integration operators''. Thus, the overall developments not only serve as a prelude towards the formal developments for ``exact integral operators'', but also demonstrate that the resulting ``approximate integral operators'' and a wide variety of ``new and existing integration operators and known methods'' are simply subsets of the generalizations of a standardized W p -Family, and emanate from the principles presented herein. The developments first leading to integral operators in time, and the resulting consequences then systematically leading to not only providing new avenues but additionally also explaining a wide variety of generalized integration operators in time of which single-step time integration operators and various widely recognized algorithms which we are familiar are simply subsets, the associated multi-step time integration operators, and a class of finite element in time integration operators, and their relationships are particularly addressed. The theoretical design developments encompass and explain a variety of time discretized operators, the recovery of various original methods of algorithmic development, and the development of new computational algorithms which have not been exploited and/or explored to-date, and furthermore, permit time discretized operators to be uniquely classified and characterized by algorithmic markers.

  copyright = {Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.},
  issn = {00295981},
  abstract = {Of fundamental interest are multidisciplinary interactions encompassing: (1) first order systems such as those encountered in parabolic heat conduction, first order hyperbolic systems such as fluid flow, and so on, and (2) second order systems such as those encountered in hyperbolic heat conduction, hyperbolic second order systems such as elastodynamics and wave propagation, and so on. After space discretization using methods such as finite differences, finite volumes, finite elements, and the like, the consequent proper integration of the time continuous ordinary differential equations is extremely important. In particular, the physical quantities of interest may need to be mostly preserved and/or the equations should be optimally integrated so that there is minimal numerical dissipation, dispersion, algorithm overshoot, capture shocks without too much dissipation, solve stiff problems and enable the completion of the analysis, and so on. To-date, practical methods in most commercial and research software include the trapezoidal family (Euler forward/backward, Galerkin, and Crank Nicholson) for first order systems and the other counterpart trapezoidal family (Newmark family and variants with controllable numerical dissipation) for second order systems. For the respective first/second order systems, they are totally separate families of algorithms and are derived from altogether totally different numerical approximation techniques. Focusing on the class of the linear multistep (LMS) methods, algorithms by design was first utilized to develop GS4-2 framework for time integration of second order systems. We have also recently developed the GS4-1 framework for integrating first order systems. In contrast to all past efforts over the past 50 years or so, we present the formalism of a generalized unified framework, termed GS4 (generalized single step single solve), that unifies GS4-1 (first-order systems) and GS4-2 (second-order systems) frameworks for simultaneous use in both first and second order systems with optimal algorithms, numerical and order preserving attributes (in particular, second-order time accuracy) as well. The principal contribution emanating from such an integrated framework is the practicality and convenience of using the same computational framework and implementation when solving first and/or second order systems without having to resort to the individual framework. All that is needed is a single novel GS4-2 framework for either second- and/or first-order systems, and we show how to switch from one to the other for illustrative applications to thermo-mechanical problems influenced by first/second order systems, respectively. \&copy; 2014 John Wiley \&amp; Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Real-time hybrid simulation is a viable and economical technique that allows researchers to observe the behavior of critical elements at full scale when an entire structure is subjected to dynamic loading. To ensure reliable experimental results, it is necessary to evaluate the actuator tracking after the test, even when sophisticated compensation methods are used to negate the detrimental effect of servo-hydraulic dynamics. Existing methods for assessment of actuator tracking are often based on time-domain analysis. This paper proposes a frequency-domain-based approach to the assessment of actuator tracking for real-time hybrid simulations. To ensure the accuracy of the proposed frequency response approach, the effects of spectrum leakage are investigated as well as the length and sampling frequency requirements of the signals. Two signal pre-processing techniques (data segmentation and window transform) are also discussed and compared to improve the accuracy of the proposed approach. Finally the effectiveness of the proposed frequency-domain-based approach is demonstrated through both computational analyses and laboratory tests, including real-time tests with predefined displacement and real-time hybrid simulation.},

  abstract = {Real-time hybrid simulation (RTHS) has increasingly been recognized as a powerful methodology to evaluate structural components and systems under realistic operating conditions. The concept of RTHS combines the advantages of both numerical analysis and physical laboratory testing. Furthermore, the enforced real-time execution condition enables testing of rate-dependent components. One of the most important challenges in RTHS is to achieve synchronized boundary conditions between computational and physical substructures. The level of synchronization, i.e., actuators tracking performance, largely governs RTHS test stability and accuracy. The objective of this study is to propose and validate a generalized procedure for multiple-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) RTHS. A loop-shaping H-infinity robust control design strategy is proposed to control the motion of the actuators. Validation experiments are performed successfully, including the challenges of multiple actuators dynamically coupled through a continuum steel moment resisting frame (MRF) specimen. The resulting framework is further utilized to evaluate the performance of a magnetorheological (MR) damper in its effectiveness to mitigate structural vibration when the structure is subjected to dynamic disturbances, e.g., earthquakes.

One target computer implements the response analysis task, wherein a large time-step is used to solve the FE substructure, and another target computer implements the signal generation task, wherein an interpolation program is used to generate control signals in a small time-step to meet the input demand of the controller. By using this strategy, the scale of the FE numerical substructure simulation may be increased significantly. The proposed scheme is initially verified by two FE numerical substructure models with 98 and 1240 degrees of freedom (DOFs). Thereafter, RTDHTs of a single frame-foundation structure are implemented where the foundation, considered as the numerical substructure, is simulated by the FE model with 1240 DOFs.

  abstract = {The need for assessing dynamic response of typical industrial piping systems subjected to seismic loading motivated the authors to apply model reduction techniques to experimental dynamic substructuring. Initially, a better insight into the dynamic response of the emulated system was provided by means of the principal component analysis. The clear understanding of reduction basis requirements paved the way for the implementation of a number of model reduction techniques aimed at extending the applicability range of the hybrid testing technique beyond its traditional scope. Therefore, several hybrid simulations were performed on a typical full-scale industrial piping system endowed with a number of critical components, like elbows, Tee joints and bolted flange joints, ranging from operational to collapse limit states. Then, the favourable performance of the L-Stable Real-Time compatible time integrator and an effective delay compensation method were also checked throughout the testing campaign Finally, several aspects of the piping performance were commented and conclusions drawn.},

  abstract = {As magnetorheological (MR) control devices increase in scale for use in real-world civil engineering applications, sophisticated modeling and control techniques may be needed to exploit their unique characteristics. Here, a control algorithm that utilizes overdriving and backdriving current control to increase the efficacy of the control device is experimentally verified and evaluated at large scale. Real-time hybrid simulation (RTHS) is conducted to perform the verification experiments using the nees@Lehigh facility. The physical substructure of the RTHS is a 10-m tall planar steel frame equipped with a large-scale MR damper. Through RTHS, the test configuration is used to represent two code-compliant structures, and is evaluated under seismic excitation. The results from numerical simulation and RTHS are compared to verify the RTHS methodology. The global responses of the full system are used to assess the performance of each control algorithm. In each case, the reduction in peak and root mean square (RMS) responses (displacement, drift, acceleration, damper force, etc.) is examined. Beyond the verification tests, the robust performance of the damper controllers is also demonstrated using RTHS. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

  abstract = {With the sub-stepping technique, the numerical analysis in real-time dynamic hybrid testing is split into the response analysis and signal generation tasks. Two target computers that operate in real-time may be assigned to implement these two tasks, respectively, for fully extending the simulation scale of the numerical substructure. In this case, the integration time-step of solving the dynamic response of the numerical substructure can be dozens of times bigger than the sampling time-step of the controller. The time delay between the real and desired feedback forces becomes more striking, which challenges the well-developed delay compensation methods in real-time dynamic hybrid testing. This paper focuses on displacement prediction and force correction for delay compensation in the real-time dynamic hybrid testing with a large integration time-step. A new displacement prediction scheme is proposed based on recently-developed explicit integration algorithms and compared with several commonly-used prediction procedures. The evaluation of its prediction accuracy is carried out theoretically, numerically and experimentally. Results indicate that the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed prediction method are of significance.},

  abstract = {Real-time hybrid simulation (RTHS) offers an economical and reliable methodology for testing integrated structural systems with rate-dependent behaviors. Within a RTHS implementation, critical components of the structural system under evaluation are physically tested, while more predictable components are replaced with computational models under a one-to-one timescale execution. As a result, RTHS implementations provide a more economical and versatile alternate approach to evaluating structural/rate-dependent systems under actual dynamic and inertial conditions, without the need for full-scale structural testing. One significant challenge in RTHS is the accurate representation of the physical complexities within the computational counterparts. For RTHS, the requirement for computational environments with reliable modeling and real-time execution capabilities is critical. Additionally, the need of a flexible environment for implementation and easy integration of such platforms with remaining RTHS components has also been established. An open-source computational platform, RT-Frame2D, for the RTHS of dynamically excited steel frame structures has been developed to satisfy these demands. The computational platform includes both adequate modeling capabilities for the nonlinear dynamic analysis of steel frame structures under real-time execution, and a versatile design to allow its efficient integration within a RTHS framework. Comparisons of RT-Frame2D modeling capabilities with those of a well-known simulation tool, in addition to challenging experimental implementations based on several RTHS scenarios, are performed herein to verify the accuracy, stability, and real-time execution performance of the proposed computational platform.},

  issn = {0098-8847},
  doi = {10/f7rkqs},
  abstract = {This paper presents real-time hybrid earthquake simulation (RTHS) on a large-scale steel structure with nonlinear viscous dampers. The test structure includes a three-story, single-bay moment-resisting frame (MRF), a three-story, single-bay frame with a nonlinear viscous damper and associated bracing in each story (called damped braced frame (DBF)), and gravity load system with associated seismic mass and gravity loads. To achieve the accurate RTHS results presented in this paper, several factors were considered comprehensively: (1) different arrangements of substructures for the RTHS; (2) dynamic characteristics of the test setup; (3) accurate integration of the equations of motion; (4) continuous movement of the servo-controlled hydraulic actuators; (5) appropriate feedback signals to control the RTHS; and (6) adaptive compensation for potential control errors. Unlike most previous RTHS studies, where the actuator stroke was used as the feedback to control the RTHS, the present study uses the measured displacements of the experimental substructure as the feedback for the RTHS, to enable accurate displacements to be imposed on the experimental substructure. This improvement in approach was needed because of compliance and other dynamic characteristics of the test setup, which will be present in most large-scale RTHS. RTHS with ground motions at the design basis earthquake and maximum considered earthquake levels were successfully performed, resulting in significant nonlinear response of the test structure, which makes accurate RTHS more challenging. Two phases of RTHS were conducted: in the first phase, the DBF is the experimental substructure, and in the second phase, the DBF together with the MRF is the experimental substructure. The results from the two phases of RTHS are presented and compared with numerical simulation results. An evaluation of the results shows that the RTHS approach used in this study provides a realistic and accurate simulation of the seismic response of a large-scale structure with rate-dependent energy dissipating devices.

  issn = {0141-0296},
  doi = {10/b7fx7g},
  abstract = {Real-time testing is a useful technique to evaluate the performance of structural systems subjected to seismic loading. Servo-hydraulic actuators can introduce an inevitable delay when applying command displacements to a structure during a real-time test due to their inherent dynamics. Various compensation methods have been developed and applied in real-time testing to minimize the effect of actuator delay. This paper proposes an approach to analyze actuator delay compensation methods using an equivalent discrete transfer function. Discrete control theory is introduced and used to formulate the discrete transfer function in the frequency domain and the difference equation in the time domain for an actuator delay compensation method. The discrete transfer function is used to conduct frequency response analysis of the compensation method to provide insight into the expected performance of the compensation method by graphically illustrating the characteristics of the compensation method as a function of frequency of command displacement and the parameters for the compensator. The difference equation gives the form of the mathematical extrapolation in the time domain for the compensation method. Three popular compensation methods are selected to illustrate the proposed approach. Experiments with predefined sine sweep displacement and real-time hybrid simulations of a single-degree-of-freedom moment resisting frame with an elastomeric damper are conducted to experimentally validate the analysis of the selected compensation methods using the proposed approach.

  doi = {10/gcp3vm},
  abstract = {Real-time hybrid testing (RTHT) involves virtual splitting of the structure into two parts: physical substructure that contains the key region of interest which is tested in a laboratory and numerical substructure that contains the remaining part of the structure in the form of a numerical model. This paper numerically assesses four step-by-step integration methods (Central difference method (CDM), Operator splitting method (OSM), Rosenbrock based method (RBM) and CR-integration method (CR)) which are widely used in RTHT. The methods have been assessed in terms of stability and accuracy for various realistic damping ratios of the physical substructure. The stability is assessed in terms of the spectral radii of the amplification matrix while the accuracy in terms of numerical damping and period distortion. In order to evaluate the performance of the methods, five carefully chosen examples have been studied - undamped SDOF, damped SDOF, instantaneous softening, instantaneous hardening and hysteretic system. The performance of the methods is measured in terms of a non-dimensional error index for displacement and velocity. Based on the error indices, it is observed that OSM and RBM are robust and performs fairly well in all the cases. CDM performed well for undamped SDOF system. CR method can be used for the system showing softening behaviour. The error indices indicate that accuracy of OSM is more than other method in case of hysteretic system. The accuracy of the results obtained through time integration methods for different damping ratios of the physical substructure is addressed in the present study. In the presence of a number of integration methods, it is preferable to have criteria for the selection of the time integration scheme. As such criteria are not available presently, this paper attempts to fill this gap by numerically assessing the four commonly used step-by-step methods.},

  abstract = {Incomplete field formulations have recently been the subject of intense research because of their potential in coupled analysis of independently modeled substructures, adaptive refinement, domain decomposition and parallel processing. This paper presents a spectral stability theory for the differential/algebraic dynamic systems associated with these formulations, discusses the design and analysis of suitable time-integration algorithms, and emphasizes the treatment of the inter-subdomain linear constraint equations. These constraints are shown to introduce a destabilizing effect in the dynamic system that can be analyzed by investigating the behavior of the time-integration algorithm at infinite and zero frequencies. Three different approaches for constructing penalty-free unconditionally stable second-order accurate solution procedures for this class of hybrid formulations are presented, analyzed and illustrated with numerical examples. In particular, the advantages of the Hilber-Hughes-Taylor (HHT) method and its generalized version (Generalized cu) are highlighted. The family of problems discussed in this paper can also be viewed as model problems for the more general case of hybrid formulations with non-linear constraints. For example, it is shown numerically in this paper that the theoretical results predicted by the spectral stability theory also apply to non-linear multibody dynamics formulations. Therefore, some of the algorithms outlined in this work are important alternatives to the popular technique consisting of transforming differential/algebraic equations into ordinary differential equations via the introduction of a stabilization term that depends on arbitrary constants, and that influences the computed solution.},

  abstract = {An unconditionally stable, fully explicit and highly precise multiple timescale finite element modeling scheme is described for a fully coupled hydro-mechanical (FCHM) analysis of saturated poroelastic media. The finite element method (FEM) is used for the discretization of the FCHM differential equation in the space domain. Direct integration is performed based on the precise time step integration method (PTSIM) for the time derivatives. Two configurations for the proposed scheme are constructed (abbreviated as PTSIM-f1 and -f2, respectively). The stability and convergence of the PTSIM-f1 and -f2 are proved using a matrix-based spectral analysis in the time domain. It is demonstrated that the explicit scheme proposed in this paper is unconditionally stable and independent of the time-step size. The algorithmic error estimation results indicate that the numerical modeling performed using PTSIM-f1 and -f2 in the time domain match the computer precision. Theoretically, the algorithmic error is caused by only the mesh discretization. Therefore, the proposed modeling scheme is a semi-analytical scheme. The applicability and accuracy of the proposed scheme are examined using sample calculations. By comparing with the analytical solutions, it is indicated that the modeling results have significant advantages over the standard FEM in terms of precision and computational efficiency for large timescales. \&copy; 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {The paper discusses adaptive procedures for elastodynamic problems using semi-discrete finite elements. The adaptivity in space may be done by mesh refinement (h-version), by increase of order of the approximation polynomials (p-version) or a combination of these (hp-version). In time, the integration is either made by mode superposition of characteristic functions or by direct integration. The adaptation in time may either be made by change of the global time-step (h-version) or increase of the order of approximation polynomials (p-version). Crucial parts of the analysis are the error estimator and the error indicator, which are based either on interpolation theory or on total energy obtained from postprocessed stresses. For the mesh generation and regeneration, an isoline technique is utilized by which the mesh can be smoothed by interpolation theory. The isolines are created for some characteristic scalar function. For time discretization, a new simple a posteriori local error estimator for the Newmark scheme is described. It is derived by a post-processing technique without solving new equations so the additional computational cost is small and the implementation is convenient. The paper also describes a sequence of nested time-integration methods for dynamic problems formulated as two first order equations in time. These nested integration methods in time based on a hierarchical formulation in time are A-stable schemes of order 2k and L-stable schemes of order 2k - 1. A considerable improvement in terms of accuracy as well as effectiveness is obtained, compared to currently available methods.},

This is obtained through configuration updates performed via the exponential map. We show how certain terms can be approximated, while retaining the order of accuracy of the scheme, and how the method conserves the total momentum of the system. Within this framework, we develop two nonlinearly unconditionally stable time integration schemes, that are associated with discrete laws of conservation/dissipation of the total energy. The dissipating algorithm generalizes to the nonlinear case the high frequency damping characteristics provided by some well-known conventional methods.

In addition, the constant average acceleration version of the Newmark method is found to be unconditionally stable and to possess no attenuation due to approximation viscosity. Truncation error due to the low-pass filtering characteristics of spatially discretized systems is highly damped by the Wilson averaging and Gurtin averaging operators; all three operators exhibit error in the period of the response which is a function of time step size.},

  abstract = {A numerical integration procedure for rotational motion using a rotation vector parametrization is explored from an engineering perspective by using rudimentary vector analysis. The incremental rotation vector, angular velocity and acceleration correspond to different tangent spaces of the rotation manifold at different times and have a non-vectorial character. We rewrite the equation of motion in terms of vectors lying in the same tangent space, facilitating vector space operations consistent with the underlying geometric structure. While any integration algorithm (that works within a vector space setting) may be used, we presently employ a family of explicit Runge\textendash{}Kutta algorithms to solve this equation. While this work is primarily motivated out of a need for highly accurate numerical solutions of dissipative rotational systems of engineering interest, we also compare the numerical performance of the present scheme with some of the invariant preserving schemes, namely ALGO-C1, STW, LIEMID[EA] and SUBCYC-M. Numerical results show better local accuracy via the present approach vis-{\'a}-vis the preserving algorithms. It is also noted that the preserving algorithms do not simultaneously preserve all constants of motion. We incorporate adaptive time-stepping within the present scheme and this in turn enables still higher accuracy and a `near preservation' of constants of motion over significantly longer intervals.},

  doi = {10/brqnk8},
  abstract = {A method of deriving parallel algorithms from well-established conventional direct integration algorithms such as the Wilson \texttheta{} method, Newmark $\beta$ method etc. is presented. The new algorithms are able to effectively exploit the power of parallel computers for the dynamic analysis of large-scale structures, and may be more efficient than the conventional methods, even on uniprocessors. It appears that the parallel algorithms can be made to maintain the property of unconditional stability displayed by the conventional methods. The parallel algorithms are derived by splitting the stiffness, damping and mass matrices such that the dynamic equations of motion can be cast in block diagonal form. The splitting of the matrices corresponds to physical subdomains of the structure. Each set of block diagonal equations can be solved independently of the others and therefore the computations can be performed in parallel. However, a predictor-corrector approach requiring iterations within a time step must be used for acceptable accuracy. The method described in this paper is derived from the Wilson \texttheta{} method and is called the ``parallel Wilson \texttheta{} method.'' A simple numerical example is used to illustrate the accuracy of the parallel method, which is comparable to the conventional method when a sufficient number of iterations is used. Preliminary computations were performed on a \{BBN\} GP-1000 distributed-memory parallel computer to assess the performance of the parallel algorithm. The proposed method is especially suited for large-scale non-linear structural dynamics problems.},

  abstract = {Implicit Newmark schemes for integration of finite rotations in structural and continuum mechanics typically are more complicated than those used for translational motion. Using Euler's representation of the rotation tensor $\Lambda$ in terms of a rotation vector $\phi$ , numerical integration connecting the values $\phi$ n , $\Lambda$ n and $\phi$ n + 1 , $\Lambda$ n + 1 at the beginning and end of the time step is expressed in terms of an incremental rotation vector \texttheta{} and the associated incremental rotation tensor $\Lambda$ ( \texttheta{} ) . Here, it is shown using backward differentiation that neglecting third order terms in \texttheta{} , the approximation for the angular velocity $\omega$ in terms of \texttheta{} and its time derivative has the same form as that between velocity and displacement. Consequently, the simplified Newmark scheme in terms of \texttheta{} , $\omega$ , $\omega$ \. has the same form as that for updating translations. Details of the Newmark scheme and an analytical expression for the tangent stiffness tensor for the associated Newton\textendash{}Raphson iteration procedure have been presented for rigid body dynamics.

  abstract = {Systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) arising from transient structural dynamics very often exhibit high-frequency/low-frequency and linear/nonlinear behaviors of subsets of the state variables. With this in mind, the paper resorts to the use of different time integrators with differential time steps for subsystems, which tailors each method and its time step to the solution behaviors of the corresponding subsystem. In detail, a partitioned integration method is introduced which imposes continuity of velocities at the interface to couple arbitrary Newmark schemes with different time steps in different subdomains. It is proved that the velocity continuity of the method is the primal factor of its reduction to first-order accuracy. To maintain second-order accuracy without increasing drift and computational cost, a novel method with the acceleration continuity is proposed whose velocity constraint is also ensured by means of the projection strategy. Both its stability and accuracy properties are examined through numerical analysis of a Single-degree-of-freedom (DoF) split mass system. Finally, numerical validations are conducted on Single-and Two-DoF split mass systems and a four-DoF nonlinear structure showing the feasibility of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {The reliability of structural dynamic systems involving random parameters can be assessed based on the equivalent extreme value distribution of response.

In each iterative step, an estimated solution is easily obtained firstly by solving a linear system of equations and the More accurate result is then searched around the estimated solution with high efficiency. The derivation is based on the principle of maximum entropy, in which an un-constrained optimization problem with fractional moments is involved. Three different methods for numerical integration of fractional moments are compared, which indicates that the bivariate dimension reduction method ensures the accuracy and efficiency simultaneously. Two examples, of which one deals with a linear random structure subjected to seismic excitation, the other deals with a nonlinear structure with random parameters subjected to random ground motions, are illustrated to validate the proposed method.

  abstract = {A high-order compact finite-difference scheme is applied and assessed for the numerical simulation of structural dynamics. The two-dimensional elastic stress-strain equations are considered in the generalized curvilinear coordinates and the spatial derivatives in the resulting equations are discretized by a fourth-order compact finite-difference scheme. For the time integration, an implicit second-order dual time-stepping method is utilized in which a fourth order Runge-Kutta scheme is used to integrate in the pseudo-time level. The accuracy and robustness of the solution procedure proposed are investigated through simulating different two-dimensional benchmark test cases in structural dynamics. A sensitivity study is also performed to examine the effect of the grid size on the accuracy and performance of the solution. The numerical results obtained by implementing the high-order compact finite-difference scheme are compared with the analytical solutions as well as the available numerical results which exhibit good agreement. The present work represents the first known implementation of the high-order compact finite-difference scheme in computational structural dynamics and that the solution methodology proposed is robust, accurate and efficient for such simulations. Note that the numerical solution procedure proposed to achieve high accurate results is simpler than the high-order finite-volume and finite-element formulations.

To illustrate the proposed approach, a number of numerical examples are presented involving multiple degree-of-freedom (DOF) structural systems built from simple rod type elements that can exhibit linear, nonlinear elastic, or elasto-plastic (bilinear) material response. The time marching algorithm that results from this approach is conditionally stable with a time step limit comparable to that of other conventional schemes, exhibits no algorithmic damping, and gives good accuracy versus time step solutions.

This method allows one to carry out analyses of undamped structures in the frequency domain, and yields highly accurate results for both discrete and continuous systems. In essence, the solution involves: (1) Finding both the transfer function and the forward Fourier transform of the excitation for complex frequencies; (2) performing a standard inverse Fourier transformation into the time domain; and (3) removing the effect of the complex frequencies by means of an exponential factor (or window). Excellent results are obtained when this factor is chosen so that the power of the excitation and response signals at the end of the window are attenuated by some three orders of magnitude. In such case, it is found that a quiet zone (a tail of trailing zeroes) is not needed for accurate computations, and that temporal aliasing (folding) is negligible. This computational advantage is achieved at the expense of having to evaluate accurately the transfer functions at each frequency step, since interpolation schemes cannot be used in this method.},

  abstract = {This paper explores a Reproducing Kernel Particle Method (RKPM) which incorporates several attractive features. The emphasis is away from classical mesh generated elements in favour of a mesh free system which only requires a set of nodes or particles in space. Using a Gaussian function or a cubic spline function, flexible window functions are implemented to provide refinement in the solution process; It also creates the ability to analyse a specific frequency range in dynamic problems reducing the computer time required. This advantage is achieved through an increase in the critical time step when the frequency range is low and a large window is used. The stability of the window function as well as the critical time step formula are investigated to provide insight into RKPMs. The predictions of the theories are confirmed through numerical experiments by performing reconstructions of given functions and solving elastic and elastic-plastic one-dimensional (1-D) bar problems for both small and large deformation as well as three 2-D large deformation non-linear elastic problems. Numerical and theoretical results show the proposed reproducing kernel interpolation functions satisfy the consistency conditions and the critical time step prediction; furthermore, the RKPM provides better stability than Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH)methods.

  volume = {20},
  issn = {0168-874X},
  doi = {10/fgnkgv},
  abstract = {For computational dynamics problems, direct time integration and mode superposition are the most widely employed approaches. Of the two, direct time stepping methods have been quite popular in many commercial codes because of their various inherent advantages. However, for numerous engineering applications, mode superposition techniques continue to be the choice of many analysts, especially for linear systems and for long time responses. To date, much progress has been made in the development and understanding of direct time integration methods for computational dynamics problems encountered in engineering. Besides investigations encompassing accuracy and stability properties of these time integration schemes, the related developments include single step, multi-step, mixed and/or variable time integration features and the like. Unlike past practices customarily employed for computational dynamics, the present paper introduces a new virtual-pulse (VIP) time integral methodology which offers several attractive and effective features. The proposed method possesses a unique solution methodology of its own, thus avoiding the need to employ any existing time stepping methods. The present paper primarily serves to lay down the fundamental developments towards establishing the theoretical basis via new perspectives for subsequent applications to general computational structural dynamics. However, for expository purposes, attention is confined only to linear structural dynamic systems in this paper; and Rayleigh damping is considered here, although non-Rayleigh damping can be readily permitted but is not described here. As a consequence, the characteristics of the methodology include (1) an explicit unconditionally stable representation, (2) second-order accuracy, (3) much less algorithmic damping than direct time integration methods advocated in existing commercial codes; if an undamped system is considered, the algorithmic damping is zero, (4) the relative period error is zero, and (5) self-starting features. Theoretical details of the developments, the stability and accuracy characteristics are described.

The functional employed involves domain displacements and boundary tractions and displacements. These variables are taken to be independent of one another. The boundary variables are expressed in terms of their nodal values while the domain displacement field is approximated by a linear combination of static fundamental solutions. The source point of the latter is located outside the domain. The resolving system is a linear system and for free vibration a classic linear algebraic eigenvalue problem is inferred. The stiffness and mass matrices are symmetric and positive definite and the domain integral, when associated with the inertial term, can be transformed into a boundary integral.

Using the generalization of average acceleration concept, a higher-order accurate and unconditionally stable time-integration method is developed. The stability analysis is carried out for a system of single, degree of freedom. The analysis proves that the present method is unconditionally stable.

  abstract = {In this paper, a precise time-step integration method for dynamic problems is presented. The second-order differential equations for dynamic problems are manipulated directly. A general damping matrix is considered. The transient responses are expressed in terms of the steady-state responses, the given initial conditions and the step-response and impulsive-response matrices. The steady-state responses for various types of excitations are readily obtainable. The computation of the step-response and impulsive-response matrices and their time derivatives are studied in this paper. A direct computation of these matrices using the Taylor series solutions is not efficient when the time-step size Delta t is not small. In this paper, the recurrence formulae relating the response matrices at t = Delta t to those at t = Delta t/2 are constructed. A recursive procedure is proposed to evaluate these matrices at t = Delta t from the matrices at t = Delta t/2(m). The matrices at t = Delta t/2(m) are obtained from the Taylor series solutions. To improve the computational efficiency, the relations between the response matrices and their time derivatives are investigated. In addition, these matrices are expressed in terms of two symmetric matrices that can also be evaluated recursively. Besides, from the physical point of view, these matrices should be banded for small Delta t. Both the stability and accuracy characteristics of the present algorithm are studied. Three numerical examples are used to illustrate the highly precise and stable algorithm. (C) 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Because most proposed solution techniques are iterative or require large matrices to be inverted and multiplied, severe obstacles arise when large models, such as, for example, typical industrial finite element models, are at hand. Here we consider finite element model updating for structural dynamic applications and show how the problem with little effort may be projected onto a subspace spanned by for instance, a few eigenvectors of the initial model. Because the subspace dimension is much smaller than the space spanned by the finite element basis, the subsequent correlation can be conducted speedily, although large changes from the initial design may require the subspace basis to be updated. The proposed method can conveniently be used for substructured models and, in addition, makes interactive design changes possible. A small model problem and an industrial application are used to illustrate the performance of the suggested approach.},

Based on using the Zienkiewicz-Zhu error estimate in space and the jumps (discontinuities) of displacements and velocities in the total energy norm as a local error estimate in time, an h-adaptive procedure which updates the spatial mesh and the time step size automatically so as to control the estimated errors within specified tolerances is proposed. Numerical examples are presented, showing that the considered DG method is of second-order accuracy in space (in L-2) and third-order accuracy in time, and the adaptive procedure is capable of updating the spatial meshes and the time steps when necessary, making the solutions reliable and the computation efficient.

Therefore, additional information, such as the locations of the unknown forces, has to be supplied a priori in order to make a unique solution possible. The present study focuses on cases where such information is not readily available. First it is shown that, given (tentatively) the spatial shape and position of the load the Betti reciprocal theorem together with a reference load case may be used to calculate the required magnitude of the unknown load so that the response fits the measurement data as well as possible in a defined sense. In this manner a large number of trial loads may be evaluated with only little computational effort, since no equation system needs to be solved. Second, the situation where several loads, each reproducing the same measurement data, have been identified is investigated An optimization problem with added discrete masses as design variables is suggested. The solution of this this problem yields a structure such that each set of responses generated by each one of the previously identified loads is clearly distinguishable at the transducer positions. The proposed method is a novel approach and should be useful in the load identification problem for an existing structure. A numerical example illustrates the application of the method.},

Our approach is motivated by the fact that: (i) the effective stiffness matrix is well conditioned because of the stabilizing effect of the diagonally dominated mass matrix, (ii) the dominance of the temporal error in implicit computations with large step size, and (iii) the utilization of a class of iterative methods where the primary computational cost is associated with a construction of the preconditioner rather than with an iterative process. One of the primary goals of the present manuscript is to control the temporal and the equilibrium solution errors and to give their a posteriori estimates. Numerical experiments reveal that the computational cost of three cycles conducted with the Generalized Aggregation Multilevel solver [1-4] is comparable to a single back substitution on the source grid, while the resulting equilibrium solution error is negligible compared with the local temporal error.

  abstract = {The Iterative Group Implicit (IGI) algorithm is developed for the parallel solution of general structural dynamic problems. In this method the original structure is partitioned into a number of a subdomains. Each subdomain is solved independently and therefore concurrently, using any traditional direct solution method. The IGI algorithm is an extension of the Group Implicit (GI) algorithm, and similarly to that method compatibility of the interface degrees of freedom is restored using a mass averaging rule. However, unlike the GI algorithm, in the IGI algorithm an iterative procedure is devised to restore equilibrium at the interface degrees of freedom. The IGI method has the same algorithmic characteristics as the underlying solution method used to solve each subdomain. Furthermore, the solution obtained by this method, once the iteration converges, is the same as the one obtained if the subdomain solution method is used to solve the whole structure. Numerical studies are carried out which demonstrate that the performance of the IGI algorithm is superior to that of the GI algorithm both in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Finally, the IGI method is highly modular and scalable, and therefore very well suited for distributed and parallel computing. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The derivation of the generalized method starts with the Taylor series approximations of the displacement, velocity, and acceleration between two time-stations. Equilibrium is satisfied in a weighted-average sense over the time-step by means of a weak form of the Galerkin procedure. The displacement, velocity, and acceleration are updated using the truncated Taylor series expressions. Numerical tests have been carried out to demonstrate the validity of the developed method.

  abstract = {A family of stochastic Newmark methods are explored for direct (path-wise or strong) integrations of stochastically driven dynamical systems of engineering interest. The stochastic excitations are assumed to be modeled by white noise processes or their filters and may be applied additively or multiplicatively. The family of stochastic Newmark maps are developed through a two-parameter, implicit Ito-Taylor expansion of the displacement and velocity vectors associated with the governing stochastic differential equations (SDE-s). Detailed estimates of local and global error orders for the response variables are provided in terms of the given time step size, h. While higher order Newmark methods lead to higher accuracies, far less random variables need to be modeled in the lower order methods to make it much more attractive from a computational point of view. For the specific case of a linear dynamical system, the stochastic Newmark map is used to obtain a closed form map for computing the temporal evolution of the response co-variance matrix. A host of numerical illustrations, covering linear and non-linear, single- and multi-degree-of-freedom dynamical systems, are provided to bring out the advantages and possible weaknesses of the methods proposed.

The corrected solutions inherit the desired stability and dissipative properties from the target solution, while accuracy is improved by iterations. Indeed, no more than two iterations are shown to be needed. The resultant algorithm leads to remarkable computational savings and can be easily implemented into existing finite element codes.

But during the springback simulation, an implicit method, which is iterative, presents the advantage of unconditional stability. The optimal solution is then to have both implicit and explicit methods readily available in the same code and to be able to switch automatically from one to the other. Criteria that decide to switch from a method to another, depending on the current dynamic, have been developed.

  abstract = {The Newmark method for the numerical integration of second order equations has been extensively used and studied along the past fifty years for structural dynamics and various fields of mechanical engineering. Easy implementation and nice properties of this method and its derivatives for linear problems are appreciated but the main drawback is the treatment of discontinuities. Zienkiewicz proposed an approach using finite element concept in time, which allows a new look at the Newmark method. The idea of this paper is to propose, thanks to this approach, the use of a time partition of the unity method denoted Time Extended Finite Element Method (TX-FEM) for improved numerical simulations of time discontinuities. An enriched basis of shape functions in time is used to capture with a good accuracy the non-polynomial part of the solution. This formulation allows a suitable form of the time-stepping formulae to study stability and energy conservation. The case of an enrichment with the Heaviside function is developed and can be seen as an alternative approach to time discontinuous Galerkin method (T-DGM), stability and accuracy properties of which can be derived from those of the TX-FEM. Then Space and Time X-FEM (STX-FEM) are combined to obtain a unified space-time discretization. This combined STX-FEM appears to be a suitable technique for space-time discontinuous problems like dynamic crack propagation or other applications involving moving discontinuities.

  abstract = {The aim of the present research is to make a comparative study of numerical explicit time integration algorithms used in the domain of shock and impact. Numerical simulation of such problems, with explicit algorithms for time integration, involves minute time steps for reasons of stability. Consequently, due to spatial discretization, very high numerical frequencies are found in the final solution in displacement or stress. Usually, the high frequencies and mode shapes of the spatially discretized equations do not accurately represent the behavior of the original problem. It has been proven that algorithms such as these of Chung-Lee, Zhai, HHT, Tchamwa-Wielgosz and the central difference method, are useful in solving problems including high-speed phenomena. The consistency, the different regions of stability, but also the ability of each numerical scheme to smooth very high frequencies are compared. Finally, the integration schemes are implemented in the HEREZH+ + finite element code developed at the LG2M laboratory [httpHwww.-lg2m.univ-ubs.fr]. For some simple problems, the solutions obtained from HEREZH + + with these different schemes are compared with continuous and discretized theoretical solutions. Conclusions are independent of the problems and can be applied to more complex geometry. For instance, following these simulations, it seems that the Tchamwa-Wielgosz and the Chung-Lee algorithms are particularly efficient in smoothing the highest frequencies. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The resulting algorithm has all exact energy equation, in which the change of energy is equal to the work of the external forces minus a quadratic form of the damping matrix. This implies unconditional stability of' the algorithm, and the relative phase error is of fourth-order. An optional high-frequency algorithmic damping is constructed by optimal combination of three different damping matrices, each proportional to either the mass or the stiffness matrix. This leads to a modified form of the undamped algorithm with scalar weights oil some of the matrices introducing damping of fourth-order in the frequency. Thus, the low-frequency response is Virtually undamped, and the algorithm remains third-order accurate even when algorithmic damping is included. The accuracy of the algorithm is illustrated by an application to pulse propagation in all elastic medium, where the algorithmic damping is Used to reduce dispersion Clue to the spatial discretization, leading to a smooth Solution with a clearly defined wave front.

However. the Newton-based corrections of the seed values, which so far have been computed in PITA and related approaches on the coarse time-grid, are eliminated to avoid artificial resonance and numerical instability.

  abstract = {The introduction of algorithmic dissipation into conservative time integration algorithms is addressed in two steps. The problem is formulated in state-space, and it is demonstrated that the use of two balanced dissipation terms-one in the equation of motion and the other in the relation between the state-space variables-can produce dissipation that increases monotonically with the modal frequency. This formulation is only partially satisfactory, because it leads to dissipation also in the low-frequency range. A substantially improved form of algorithmic dissipation is then developed by representing the two balanced dissipation terms via auxiliary state-space variables related to the displacement and velocity increments by a first-order filter. The filter technique retains the high-frequency behavior of the original balanced algorithm, but reduces the low-frequency dissipation from first order in the frequency to third order. Energy balance equations are derived, and the behavior of the two algorithms is described by detailed spectral analysis with explicit asymptotic results directly in terms of the damping parameter of the algorithms. Both algorithms satisfy full symmetry of displacement and normalized velocity variables for the free algorithmically damped vibration of any single mode and, therefore, exhibit monotonic transients without `overshoot' effects. It is also demonstrated how the algorithm can be arranged in `single solve' format, where only the displacement update requires a matrix equation solution, while the velocity and the auxiliary state-space variables are updated subsequently in each time step by simple vector relations with scalar coefficients.

LS integration methods were presented in original work of the author in [International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering 71 (2007) 1598-1632]. These methods are L-stable in sense of ``Maximal Damping of High-frequency Accelerations (MDHA)''. Family of unconditionally stable implicit LS methods provides strong dissipation of high-frequency modes and has so-called U0-V0 overshoot properties (zero-order displacement and velocity overshoots). LS methods belong to generalized linear multi-step class of integration methods with second derivative (GLMSd2) and employ direct use of non-modified dynamic equations. Besides, LS methods show the identical rate of convergence in displacements, velocities and accelerations or, in other words, they are ``symmetrically converging'' (SC) algorithms in all three integration levels. In the current paper, two-step Lambda integration method is developed. This method also has U0-V0 and SC features and depends on a parameter lambda such that as lambda is varied from 0 to 1, the method is varied from LS-2 method with MDHA property of dissipation to Newmark method of average acceleration. Since latter method has no numerical damping, dissipation can be changed from maximum to zero. This provides wide functionality of Lambda method. Lambda integration method is unconditionally stable and has the second order of accuracy. Numerical dissipation, phase dispersion and high-frequency damping of this ``direct time'' two-step method are compared with similar properties of contemporary ``weighted residual'' one-step integration methods, such as Hilber-Hughes-Taylor (HHT-alpha) method and generalized single step single solve optimal (GSSSS-optimal) method.

  abstract = {Very small time steps are usually needed in numerical computation as conventional time integration methods are used to compute the response of a structure subjected to a dynamic loading with rapid changes or load discontinuity. To overcome this drawback, this study proposed a fast, fourth-order accurate step-by-step time integration (FASSTI) algorithm that is unconditionally stable and allows larger time steps for linear dynamic problems. From the stability and accuracy analysis, it is shown that the FASSTI algorithm retains the features of unconditional stability, accuracy, and fast convergence than the Newmark method. As a first test, a closed-form solution of an excited single degree of freedom (SDOF) system is derived and used to verify the reliability of the present algorithm in solving linear dynamic problems. In the numerical examples, the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated in the solution of the dynamic response of an SDOF system under a series of impulse-type forces.},

  abstract = {A high-order local transmitting boundary to model the propagation of acoustic or elastic, scalar or vector-valued waves in unbounded domains of arbitrary geometry is proposed. It is based on an improved continued-fraction solution of the dynamic stiffness matrix of an unbounded medium. The coefficient matrices of the continued-fraction expansion are determined recursively from the scaled boundary finite element equation in dynamic stiffness. They are normalised using a matrix-valued scaling factor, which is chosen such that the robustness of the numerical procedure is improved. The resulting continued-fraction solution is suitable for systems with many DOFs. It converges over the whole frequency range with increasing order of expansion and leads to numerically more robust formulations in the frequency domain and time domain for arbitrarily high orders of approximation and large-scale systems. Introducing auxiliary variables, the continued-fraction solution is expressed as a system of linear equations in i? in the frequency domain. In the time domain, this corresponds to an equation of motion with symmetric, banded and frequency-independent coefficient matrices. It can be coupled seamlessly with finite elements. Standard procedures in structural dynamics are directly applicable in the frequency and time domains. Analytical and numerical examples demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method to an existing approach and its suitability for time-domain simulations of large-scale systems.

  doi = {10/f34fw5},
  abstract = {This paper presents the Expectation Maximization algorithm (EM) applied to operational modal analysis of structures. The EM algorithm is a general-purpose method for maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) that in this work is used to estimate state space models. As it is well known, the MLE enjoys some optimal properties from a statistical point of view, which make it very attractive in practice. However, the EM algorithm has two main drawbacks: its slow convergence and the dependence of the solution on the initial values used. This paper proposes two different strategies to choose initial values for the EM algorithm when used for operational modal analysis: to begin with the parameters estimated by Stochastic Subspace Identification method (SSI) and to start using random points. The effectiveness of the proposed identification method has been evaluated through numerical simulation and measured vibration data in the context of a benchmark problem. Modal parameters (natural frequencies, damping ratios and mode shapes) of the benchmark structure have been estimated using SSI and the EM algorithm. On the whole, the results show that the application of the EM algorithm starting from the solution given by SSI is very useful to identify the vibration modes of a structure, discarding the spurious modes that appear in high order models and discovering other hidden modes. Similar results are obtained using random starting values, although this strategy allows us to analyze the solution of several starting points what overcome the dependence on the initial values used.

Therefore, stress wave have a significant effect on the life of composite structures. In this study, a four sub-step explicit time integration scheme is proposed for solving stress wave propagation problems. This method builds on the fourth-order central difference method and a high-order derivative term to minimize the numerical oscillation. The proposed scheme possesses a first-order accuracy in the case of undamped and damped systems. Stability, accuracy, and dispersion of the proposed explicit direct time integration scheme are analyzed. Furthermore, the performance of this scheme is illustrated by the solution of a stress wave propagation and wave reflection in a one-dimensional impact problem and two-dimensional scalar wave propagation.},

  title = {Effective Implementation of a Time Discontinuous {{Galerkin}} Method},
  abstract = {Abstract This work deals with time integration methods for linear dynamics. The semidiscrete equations are generally derived from standard finite element procedures and only a few low-frequency modes are accurate approximations of the underlying continuous problem. Thus, the quality of simulations depends crucially on the accuracy properties of the time integration method in the low-frequency modes, as well as on the dissipative properties in the high-frequency ones. The Time Discontinuous Galerkin (TDG) method possesses these desirable properties and has been successfully applied to linear dynamics (see e.g. (1)). Despite its good properties, it typically leads to systems of coupled equations which are larger than the original one, so that standard implementations are very demanding for both storage and computational work. Thus, developing effective implementations plays a key role in the practical application of the method. The purpose of this work is to establish an efficient iterative procedure to implement the TDG method. Differently from previous implementations (see e.g. (2) and (3)), the present procedure is designed to generate a sequence of updated values for displacements and velocities, by searching for the TDG solution while preserving the TDG stability and dissipative properties at each iteration. Improving only accuracy is demanded to iterative corrections. The idea for the iterative scheme stems from the implementation of the N酶rsett methods (4). The scheme is established so to obtain at the first iteration a N酶rsett approximant with the target stability and dissipative properties. The resultant procedure is simple and offers several advantages. Remarkable computational savings are achieved since the iterative corrections are performed using the same iteration matrix, which retains the structure of the original system and can be factorized only once for each fixed time step size. No more than two iterations are needed to obtain the same overall accuracy of the TDG method. Second order accuracy is achieved at the first iteration and third order accuracy at the second one.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT This work presents a simple and efficient iterative procedure aimed at improving the properties of N酶rsett methods for linear dynamics towards those of Pad茅 methods. The procedure is used to implement a set of higher-order methods with controllable dissipation, recently presented by the authors. Some numerical tests demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed implementation. Competitive time stepping methods for finite element analysis in linear dynamics should possess certain peculiar attributes. In addition to unconditional stability, the salient properties are higher-order accuracy and controllable dissipation in the spurious high modes. Higher-order accuracy is crucial for long-term simulations in order to avoid an excessive accumulation of error. Moreover, some amount of dissipation in the higher modes is desirable in order to damp out their response, as it is well known that only a few low-frequency modes of the semidiscrete problem are accurate approximations to the modes of the original continuous problem. Indeed, the dissipative properties of most of the established A-and L-stable methods can be unsatisfactory. A-stable methods can damp out the high-frequency modes too slowly and spurious effects can show up. On the other hand, L-stable methods can introduce excessive dissipation in the low-mode response and this can affect the accuracy especially in long-term simulations. Therefore, a specific algorithmic parame-ter should be available to control the amount of numerical dissipation according to the importance of the spurious modal components.},

A second-order (in time) differential operator equation (e.g. obtained after finite element discretization in space) is written as a pair of first-order equations in terms of displacements and velocities. Then the solution is sought by minimizing the inner product of the residuals in the two equations (an unconventional approach) over typical time interval to obtain a symmetric set of algebraic equations involving displacements and velocities at two subsequent intervals. The new time integration scheme is termed the cross weighted-residual (CWR) time integration scheme because each of the two residuals takes the other one as a weight function in the minimization. The CWR time integration scheme is developed by using a uniform linear time approximation of the displacement and velocity fields to yield only a single step time integration scheme, which is comparable to the Newmark family of time integration scheme. A reduced integration technique is used to prevent velocity locking, which is caused by linear approximation of both the displacement and velocity fields. For the verification of the consistency and the stability, the CWR time integration scheme is tested with single-degree as well as multi-degree of freedom problems. The scheme performs extremely well compared with those of the well-known Newmark family of time integration schemes.},

  abstract = {The response of a random dynamical system is totally characterized by its probability density function (pdf). However, determining a pdf by a direct approach requires a high numerical cost; similarly, surrogate models such as direct polynomial chaos expansions are not generally efficient, especially around the eigenfrequencies of the dynamical system. In the present study, a new approach based on Pad\&eacute; approximants to obtain moments and pdf of the dynamic response in the frequency domain is proposed. A key difference between the direct polynomial chaos representation and the Pad\&eacute; representation is that the Pad\&eacute; approach has polynomials in both numerator and denominator. For frequency response functions, the denominator plays a vital role as it contains the information related to resonance frequencies, which are uncertain. A Galerkin approach in conjunction with polynomial chaos is proposed for the Pad\&eacute; approximation. Another physics-based approach, utilizing polynomial chaos expansions of the random eigenmodes, is proposed and compared with the proposed Pad\&eacute; approach. It is shown that both methods give accurate results even if a very low degree of the polynomial expansion is used. The methods are demonstrated for two degree-of-freedom system with one and two uncertain parameters. Copyright \&copy; 2016 John Wiley \&amp; Sons, Ltd.

  issn = {00295981},
  abstract = {In many engineering problems, the behavior of dynamical systems depends on physical parameters. In design optimization, these parameters are determined so that an objective function is minimized. For applications in vibrations and structures, the objective function depends on the frequency response function over a given frequency range, and we optimize it in the parameter space. Because of the large size of the system, numerical optimization is expensive. In this paper, we propose the combination of Quasi-Newton type line search optimization methods and Krylov-Pade\&acute; type algebraic model order reduction techniques to speed up numerical optimization of dynamical systems. We prove that Krylov-Pade\&acute; type model order reduction allows for fast evaluation of the objective function and its gradient, thanks to the moment matching property for both the objective function and the derivatives towards the parameters. We show that reduced models for the frequency alone lead to significant speed ups. In addition, we show that reduced models valid for both the frequency range and a line in the parameter space can further reduce the optimization time. \&copy; 2012 John Wiley \&amp; Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Abstract One-step algorithms are compared for the direct time integration of the spatially discretized equations of linear elastodynamics. Explicit and implicit methods are evaluated for stability and accuracy in terms of the frequency spectrum of the continuum as well as discrete solution. The closed form of the discrete spectrum of a bar and beam are given to illustrate inherent errors of a spatial discretization. Additional errors of a direct time integration scheme are interpreted in terms of the discrete modes. The Newmark family of second-order difference approximations is found superior to either the original or extended Wilson methods, and to that of Houboult. Less than half as many time steps are required for comparable accuracy. If an upper bound on the highest frequency of a system is found, an optimum algorithm for a given time step can be found, rather than the usual selection of a time step for a given algorithm. The algorithmic damping admitted by the Newmark family can be controlled as a 鈥渓inear artificial viscosity鈥 to smooth shock discontinuities without the excessive damping of the Wilson and Houboult methods. The implications of these algorithms in wave propagation problems are illustrated.},

  abstract = {Frequency-based methods were set up in order to circumvent the limits of classical finite element methods in fast dynamic simulations due to discretizations. In this approach the dynamic loading was shifted in the frequency domain by FFT, then treated by the Variational Theory of Complex Rays, and then the time response was reconstructed through an IFFT. This strategy proved to be very efficient due to the CPU VTCR very low cost. However in the case of a large loading spectrum this frequency-by-frequency approach could seriously degrade the computational performances of the strategy. This paper addresses this point by proposing the use of Pad\&eacute; approximants in order to limit the number of frequencies at which the response should be calculated. Pad\&eacute; approximation is applied to the overall VTCR system based on its frequency dependency. Finally, as simulations on a simple academic case and on a civil engineering structure show, this method is found to be very efficient for interpolating the frequency response functions of a complex structure. This is a key point to preserve the efficiency of the complete VTCR strategy for transient dynamic problems. \&copy; 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

A straightforward solution of big systems requires a high computational cost; therefore several Model Order Reduction (MOR) techniques have been developed in the last decades to obtain faster and efficient results. Between them interpolatory approaches have gained importance for solving second order dynamical systems. This work presents and compares ten MOR techniques which are suitable for structural dynamics problems. These are: Guyan-Irons Reduction, Improved Reduction System, Dynamic Reduction, Real Modal Analysis, Complex Modal Analysis, Craig-Bampton Method, and Interpolatory MOR methods like Multi-point Pad\&eacute; Approximation, the Krylov-based Galerkin Projection and the Derivativebased Galerkin Projection. A brief summary of the theoretical background is presented for each method. A first numerical example shows the applicability for damped systems and a second example shows suitability of the Interpolatory MOR methods for industrial applications, using data from a commercial FE software (ANSYS\&reg;).},

  abstract = {In this paper, bi-discontinuous time step integration algorithms for Linear second-order equations are investigated. The second-order equations are manipulated directly. Both the initial and final displacement and velocity are only weakly enforced at the beginning and at the end of the time interval. As a result, there may be discontinuous jumps for both the displacement and velocity at the two ends of the time interval. If the displacement is assumed to be a polynomial of degree n+1 within the time interval, there are n+4 unknowns in the formulation. It is found that the order of accuracy would be at least n+1 for displacement and n for velocity in general. It is shown that the relevant algorithmic parameters for the second-order equations can be related to the algorithmic parameters presented in Part 1 of this paper for the first-order equations. Unconditionally stable higher order accurate time step integration algorithms with controllable numerical dissipation equivalent to the generalized Pad茅 approximations with an order of accuracy 2 n+3 can then be constructed systematically.

In the conventional time integration methods, the required accuracy is always achieved by either decreasing the size of time steps or increasing the order of approximations. The proposed method, however, does not require a restriction on the size of the time step. The required approximating functions for integration of governing equations are determined using the concept of reproduction of the solution within each time step. A recurrence relationship is obtained through solving the governing equation by the point collocation based reproducing kernel method within the time step. In collocation points, the values of external excitation can be obtained either through the approximation between the values at the beginning and the end of each time step or assigning the exact values of the external force. Hence, one advantage of this new method is the independency of the sampling rates of external excitation from the size of the time step.

The sine and cosine matrices involved in the scheme are calculated using the so-called N 2 algorithm, and the corresponding particular solution is also presented where the excitation vector is approximated by the truncated Taylor series. The performance and numerical behaviors of the second-order scheme of the PTI method are tested by a series of numerical examples in comparison with the first-order scheme or with the traditional time-marching Newmark-尾 method as the reference. The issue of spurious high-frequency responses resulting from spatial discretization for shock-excited structural dynamic analysis is also studied in the framework of the second-order PTI method. The effects of spatial discretization, numerical damping and time step on solution accuracy are explored by analyzing longitudinal vibrations of a shock-excited rod with rectangular, half-triangular and Heaviside step impact.},

  abstract = {The use of Finite Element and Finite Difference methods of spatial and temporal discretization for solving structural dynamics problems gives rise to purely numerical errors. Among the many numerical methods used to damp out the spurious oscillations occurring in the high frequency domain, it is proposed here to analyse and compare the Bulk Viscosity method, which involves calculating the stresses, and a method recently presented by Tchamwa and Wielgosz, which is based on an explicit time integration algorithm. The 1-D study and the 2-D axisymmetric study on a bar subjected to compression and impact loads presented here show that the former method is insensitive to meshing irregularities, whereas the latter method is not. The Bulk Viscosity method was found to be sensitive, however, to the behavior of the material, contrary to the Tchamwa鈥揥ielgosz method. Since comparisons of this kind are rather complex, a specific method of analysis was developed.},

Developing the ideas following the original works in References ( Int. J. Numer. Meth. Engng 2004; 59 :597-668, Int. J. Numer. Meth. Engng 2004; 60 :1699-1740, Int. J. Numer. Meth.

Generalized single step single solve (GSSSS) optimal algorithm recently developed and basic well-known weighted-residual methods are compared with level-symmetric (LS) integration methods proposed. These LS methods are created as symmetric variants of extended three-level (3L-LMS) integration algorithm with direct use of dynamic equations to obtain algorithmically simple integration methods, which belong to [U0-V0] L-stable optimal class without overshoots and have the maximum damping of high-frequency modes. General formulas for L-stable family of multi-step LS-N methods are obtained. Standard two-level representation (2L-LMS) of 3L-LMS integration algorithm is also obtained, and L-stable second-order accurate LS-BDF integration method for the stiff first-order ordinary differential equations is proposed. Roots, dissipation and dispersion properties of LS-1 integration method (second-order accurate in displacement) and of other obtained LS-2, LS-3, LS-4 methods (third-order accurate in displacement) are analysed and demonstrated. Comparison with some up-to-date integration methods is considered in three numerical examples. Copyright 漏 2007 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  title = {A New Space-Time Finite Element Method for the Dynamic Analysis of {{TRUSS}}-Type Structures},
  abstract = {Truss-type structures are widely used in contemporary constructions. The dynamic analysis is very important to ensure the safety and the functionalities of these structures. The aim of this research was to propose a new method tailored for the dynamic analysis of linear truss-type structures. The proposed method is a single-step method underpinned by Unconventional Hamilton-type Variational Principles, and employing the finite element discretisation in both spatial and temporal domains. To develop the proposed method, five Unconventional Hamilton-type Variational Principles tailor-made for truss-type structures were derived, preserving naturally all necessary conditions for the dynamic analysis without the introduction of any artificial factors. The resultant one-field and the two-filed formulations were used to build algorithms for the proposed method. The semi-discretisation treatment of the spatial and temporal domains was applied to these formulations. While the spatial discretisation was undertaken in the standard fashion, temporal discretisation was attempted with four different types of time finite elements. The convergence of the algorithms was examined in terms of the stability and the consistency properties. Numerical examples with different types of truss-type structures were given to verify the proposed method, and also to compare the performance of these algorithms against the existing analysis methods. The proposed algorithms were shown to be second- or higher-order accurate when various time finite elements were employed. Compared to the widely used Average Acceleration Method (AAM), the proposed method produces highly accurate results. Larger time steps can be used without compromising the accuracy hence the computational costs may be reduced. Therefore, the proposed method can provide a fast and high-precision analysis solution for applications where these attributes are desired.},

The traditional G-a method has undesired overshoot properties as for a class of alpha-method.

An analysis on the stability, accuracy, energy and overshoot properties of the proposed scheme is performed in the nonlinear regime. The values or the ranges of values of the seven independent parameters are determined in the analysis process. The computational results obtained by the new algorithm show that the displacement accuracy is of order two, and the acceleration can also be improved to a second order accuracy by a suitable choice of parameters. Obviously, the present algorithm is zero-stable, and the energy conservation or energy decay can be realized in the high-frequency range, which can be regarded as stable in an energy sense. The algorithmic overshoot can be completely avoided by using the new algorithm without any constraints with respect to the damping force and initial conditions.},

  abstract = {Traditional principles of mechanics are primarily conceived for constant mass systems, which are only valid if mass is gained or lost at null velocity with respect to an inertial reference frame for variable mass systems, thus the numerical algorithms for time-varying structures based on these principles are only suitable for this special case. In this paper, Hamilton's law of variable mass system is derived based on Meshchersky's fundamental equation, and two classes of novel time finite element formulations for linear systems with arbitrary continuous time-varying parameters are developed based on the previous law. The formulations are verified extensively through numerical examples in which the convergence and effectiveness of algorithms are evaluated. Numerical examples demonstrate that compared with the algorithms for time-varying structures that developed based on traditional principles of mechanics, the proposed algorithms provide extended capabilities in both time-varying mass problems that mass is gained or lost at any velocity (such as rocket problem) and moving-mass problems (such as vehicle-bridge interaction problem) besides the time-varying stiffness and damping problems, the proposed algorithms have a wider range of application. In particular, Hamilton's law of variable mass system provides a solid theoretical foundation for further research on the algorithm design for time-varying structures.

In addition, limitations on minimum time step resulting from the approximation that load varies linearly between timesteps are reduced by introducing a polynomial approximation of the load. This means that, in situations where a rapidly varying or transient dynamic load occurs, a larger time-step can still be used while maintaining a good approximation of the forcing function and, hence, the accuracy of the solution. Numerical examples of the HPD-NL scheme compared with Newmark's method and the fourth-order Runge-Kutta (Kutta 4) method are presented.

  abstract = {Wind and gravity both impact trees in storms, but wind loads greatly exceed gravity loads in most situations. Complex behavior of trees in windstorms is gradually turning into a controversial concern among ecological engineers. To better understand the effects of nonlinear behavior of trees, the dynamic forces on tree structures during periods of high winds have been examined as a mass-spring system. In fact, the simulated dynamic forces created by strong winds are studied in order to determine the responses of the trees to such dynamic loads. Many of such nonlinear differential equations are complicated to solve. Therefore, this paper focuses on an accurate and simple solution, Differential Transformation Method (DTM), to solve the derived equation. In this regard, the concept of differential transformation is briefly introduced. The approximate solution to this equation is calculated in the form of a series with easily computable terms. Then, the method has been employed to achieve an acceptable solution to the presented nonlinear differential equation. To verify the accuracy of the proposed method, the obtained results from DTM are compared with those from the numerical solution. The results reveal that this method gives successive approximations of high accuracy solution. \&copy; 2012-IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.},

By adopting the temporal discretization for time finite element approximation, very large time steps can be used by the algorithm. With an accuracy of fourth order, this technique requires only displacements and velocities to be made available at the start of the current time step for integration in state space. Using the weighted momentum principle, the problem of discontinuity caused by impulsive loads is resolved after time-integration of the applied load in external momentum. Since no knowledge is required of acceleration at the current time step, the errors caused by estimation of acceleration by previous finite-difference methods are circumvented. Moreover, an iterative procedure is included for each time step, involving the three phases of predictor, corrector, and error-checking. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm in solving nonlinear dynamic problems is demonstrated in the numerical examples.},

  abstract = {In this paper, an explicit time integration method to determine the linear response of arbitrary structures subjected to dynamic loading is proposed. The total time of dynamic loading is divided into several time steps. For each two time steps, in modeling the acceleration over time domain, a second order polynomial with three unknown parameters is assumed. Validity and effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through two examples where the results of this method are compared with those numerical methods. In this method, over two steps, six unknown responses (three responses for each time step) consisting of two displacements, two velocities and two accelerations are computed. This property reduces the computational cost of the proposed method as compared to Central difference, Houbolt, Newmark (linear and average), Wilsonetc. Furthermore, accuracy of the results obtained from the proposed method is better than other methods for single and multi-degree of freedom systems. Hence, as advantages of the proposed method, this method has appropriate convergence, accuracy and low computational time. Therefore, the novelty of this work is that for very small values of, this method is more precise and less time consuming rather than other existed methods.

Thus, there is a need for low order methods that allow relatively large steps and that are computationally not expensive. In this paper, we introduce a class of Runge-Kutta-Nystr{\"o}m methods that meet the requirements above. The methods generalize the well-known St{\"o}rmer's rule and allow a maximization of the stability domain.},

  title = {{L-稳定格式求解结构动力学方程和多体系统动力学方程}},
  abstract = {航天工程实际问题中包含大量结构和机构系统,如卫星包含天线和帆板等柔性结构,天线和帆板展开过程又是机构运动。研究结构的动力学行为,通常是对结构动力学方程进行研究;研究机构的运动,通常利用多体系统动力学的建模理论,建立多体系统动力学方程。空间离散的结构动力学方程为常做分方程的初值问题,多体系统动力学方程为做分一代数方程的初值问题。本文的主要目的是试图研究这两类方程的数值求解。 采用Runge-Kutta方法求解结构动力学方程。针对增量形式的结构动力学方程,推导了Runge-Kutta方法的迭代形式,研究了降低计算量的两种办法,发现了一些传统格式与Runge-Kutta方法之间的关系。基于单自由度自由振动方程,推导了Runge-Kutta方法求解结构动力学方程的逼近算子,直用逼近算子的谱半径可以分析Runge-Kutta方法求解二阶常做分方程的稳定性。通过谱半径图分析出各种格式的数值阻尼的强弱,发现高精度的L-稳定格式具有理想的数值阻尼,在精确求解低频振动的同时很好的抑制高频震荡。通过算例研究,发现较小的物理阻尼在精确解上能快速的耗散高频震荡,对数值计算却影响很小。从而得出结论:在数值计算中通过增加物理阻尼抑制高频震荡是不可行,而采用有数值阻尼的算法才是可行的。 直用适合求解高指标做分-代数方程的求解器,求解高指标形式的多体系统动力学方程。发现采用高指标形式的多体系统动力学方程,使用隐式形式做分方程需要引入新的求解变量少,而且能保持原系统矩阵的稀疏特性。但是存在两个缺点:(1)加速度变量和拉格朗日乘子的求解精度低于位移变量、速度变量的求解精度;(2)对协调一致的初始条件很依赖。针对这两个缺点,提出了对加速度变量和拉格朗日乘子修正的办法。采用修正能提高加速度变量和拉格朗日乘子的求解精度,提高整个计算过程中的收敛性。数值算例表明,采用修正能降低求解的计算量,特别对于容许误差很小的情况,计算量降低更显著。 基于做分方程精确解的Taylor展式,提出了一种新的构造块格式方法;并采用指数函数的Pade逼近作为块格式的稳定性函数,构造出L-稳定的块格式。实际上,块格式也是一类Runge-Kutta方法,从而通过Runge-Kutta方法的精度条件,分析了L-稳定块格式的精度。针对隐式形式做分方程,推导了块格式的并行迭代和局部误差估计方法,采用变步长实现了6阶精度L-稳定格式,编制了求解器PBIDE(Prallell Blocksolver for Implicit Differential Equations)。 针对Runge-Kutta方法在求解做分一代数方程中出现精度降低的情况,提出了多步块格式。分析了多步块格式稳定性和精度条件,证明其为刚性精确的,且级精度与格式精度相同。数值算例表明在求解指标-2的做分-代数方程不会出现精度降低现象。构造出了2级3阶精度的多步块格式,此格式的稳定性函数为指数函数的4阶精度广义Pade逼近,且是L-稳定的;构造出了3级4阶精度的多步块格式,此格式的稳定性函数与Runge-Kutta的稳定性函数一样,为指数函数的有理分式逼近,也是L-稳定格式。推导了多步块格式的Nordsieck表达。基于2级3阶精度的多步块格式,对隐式形式做分方程,采用变步长进行了实现,编制了求解器MBIDE(Multistep Block solverfor Implicit Differential Equations)。 对求解器PBIDE和MBIDE进行测试,与现在使用广泛的求解器进行比较,比较了它们的运行精度和计算量。选用结构动力学的算例、多体系统动力学的算例和几个其它类型的算例对本文的两个求解器进行了测试,测试的结果表明这两个求解器是效率很高的。},

  title = {Explicit/Implicit Partitioning and a New Explicit Form of the Generalized Alpha Method},
  volume = {19},
  abstract = {abstract Most finite element packages use the Newmark algorithm for time integration of structural dynamics. Various algorithms have been proposed to better optimize the high frequency dissipation of this algorithm. Hulbert and Chung proposed both implicit and explicit forms of the generalized alpha method. The algorithms optimize high frequency dissipation effectively, and despite recent work on algorithms that possess momentum conserving/energy dissipative properties in a non-linear context, the generalized alpha method remains an efficient way to solve many problems, especially with adaptive timestep control. However, the implicit and explicit algorithms use incompatible parameter sets and cannot be used together in a spatial partition, whereas this can be done for the Newmark algorithm, as Hughes and Liu demonstrated, and for the HHT-algorithm developed from it. The present paper shows that the explicit generalized alpha method can be rewritten so that it becomes compatible with the implicit form. All four algorithmic parameters can be matched between the explicit and implicit forms. An element interface between implicit and explicit partitions can then be used, analogous to that devised by Hughes and Liu to extend the Newmark method. The stability of the explicit/implicit algorithm is examined in a linear context and found to exceed that of the explicit partition. The element partition is significantly less dissipative of intermediate frequencies than one using the HHT-method. The explicit algorithm can also be rewritten so that the discrete equation of motion evaluates forces from displacements and velocities found at the predicted mid-point of a cycle.

  abstract = {This paper deals with the accuracy of a numerical time integration scheme, the implicit Generalized-$\alpha$ method, when applied near resonant conditions in periodic steady-state vibrations of elastic linear and non-linear systems. In order to evaluate errors, analytical solutions of frequency response functions (FRFs) are determined by using the Harmonic Balance method in single- and two-degrees-of-freedom viscously damped systems, where the non-linearity is introduced through hardening Duffing oscillators. Successively, the Generalized-$\alpha$ method is implemented in conjunction with the Harmonic Balance method to trace numerical solutions of FRFs. It is shown that the effective resulting algorithm, the Algorithmic Harmonic Balance- $\rho$ $\infty$ method, can define non-linear FRFs and allows the errors exhibited by the integration scheme near resonance in terms of frequency location and amplitude of the resonant peak to be quantified. The accuracy estimates demonstrate the robustness of the Generalized-$\alpha$ method also in the forced case and confirm its capability to reproduce amplitudes at resonance in the low frequency range and damp out them in the high frequency range.},

  abstract = {Real-time hybrid simulation provides a viable method to experimentally evaluate the performance of structural systems subjected to earthquakes. The structural system is divided into substructures, where part of the system is modeled by experimental substructures, whereas the remaining part is modeled analytically. The displacements in a real-time hybrid simulation are imposed by servo-hydraulic actuators to the experimental substructures. Actuator delay compensation has been shown by numerous researchers to vitally achieve reliable real-time hybrid simulation results. Several studies have been performed on servo-hydraulic actuator delay compensation involving single experimental substructure with single actuator. Research on real-time hybrid simulation involving multiple experimental substructures, however, is limited. The effect of actuator delay during a real-time hybrid simulation with multiple experimental substructures presents challenges. The restoring forces from experimental substructures may be coupled to two or more degrees of freedom (DOF) of the structural system, and the delay in each actuator must be adequately compensated. This paper first presents a stability analysis of actuator delay for real-time hybrid simulation of a multiple-DOF linear elastic structure to illustrate the effect of coupled DOFs on the stability of the simulation. An adaptive compensation method then proposed for the stable and accurate control of multiple actuators for a real-time hybrid simulation. Real-time hybrid simulation of a two-story four-bay steel moment-resisting frame with large-scale magneto-rheological dampers in passive-on mode subjected to the design basis earthquake is used to experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of the compensation method in minimizing actuator delay in multiple experimental substructures.

Therefore, numerical and/or physical substructures as well as numerical solution methods have to be adapted to the needs of real-time simulations. Monolithic stable numerical methods are implicit and cannot be easily used in real-time applications because of their iterative strategies necessary to solve the nonlinear corrector equations. As an alternative, in the present paper, we consider linearly implicit Rosenbrock-based L-stable real-time (LSRT) compatible algorithms with both two-stage and three-stage. Moreover, other linearly implicit structural integrators used nowadays to perform coupled simulations in real time are introduced too. Successively, typical properties of monolithic algorithms are shown when large time steps are employed. The loss of stability and the reduction of accuracy of these algorithms, when applied to coupled systems caused by kinematically closed loops, are analyzed in-depth through a split-inertia substructured system. In this respect, the benefits of the L-stability property are shown. Finally, the performance of the algorithms under investigation appears in a number of more realistic tests considering both nonstiff and stiff substructures.},

  doi = {10/gcp3vq},
  abstract = {The equivalent force control (EFC) method has been developed for real-time substructure testing with implicit integration to replace the numerical iterative process with feedback control. This paper addresses two issues concerning the performance of this method. One is the determination of the force-displacement conversion factor (a key component of EFC) for nonlinear specimens. The analysis conducted here shows that the force-displacement conversion factor is largely governed by the properties of the numerical substructure and the numerical scheme when a small integration time interval is used. Otherwise, the factor has to be determined with the secant stiffness of the specimen and of the numerical substructure if a proportional-derivative controller is used for EFC. The other issue is the overshooting problem, which may arise for multidegree-of-freedom structures because of the relatively quick response feedback from the numerical substructure in the closed-loop EFC. This problem can be resolved by reducing either the EFC gains or the increment size of the equivalent force command. The analytical studies on these two issues are verified by numerical simulations and for real-time substructure tests conducted on structural models with buckling restrained braces. Furthermore, a real-time substructure test was conducted on an offshore platform with magnetorheological dampers in order to serve as an example of a practical application of the method.

  volume = {42},
  issn = {0098-8847},
  doi = {10/f46z9v},
  abstract = {Hydraulic actuators are typically used in a real-time hybrid simulation to impose displacements to a test structure (also known as the experimental substructure). It is imperative that good actuator control is achieved in the real-time hybrid simulation to minimize actuator delay that leads to incorrect simulation results. The inherent nonlinearity of an actuator as well as any nonlinear response of the experimental substructure can result in an amplitude-dependent behavior of the servo-hydraulic system, making it challenging to accurately control the actuator. To achieve improved control of a servo-hydraulic system with nonlinearities, an adaptive actuator compensation scheme called the adaptive time series (ATS) compensator is developed. The ATS compensator continuously updates the coefficients of the system transfer function during a real-time hybrid simulation using online real-time linear regression analysis. Unlike most existing adaptive methods, the system identification procedure of the ATS compensator does not involve user-defined adaptive gains. Through the online updating of the coefficients of the system transfer function, the ATS compensator can effectively account for the nonlinearity of the combined system, resulting in improved accuracy in actuator control. A comparison of the performance of the ATS compensator with existing linearized compensation methods shows superior results for the ATS compensator for cases involving actuator motions with predefined actuator displacement histories as well as real-time hybrid simulations.

  abstract = {Decentralized integral control is one of the most popular control strategies used in practice. An important issue associated with this strategy is the analysis of Decentralized Integral Controllability (DIC). Campo and Morari showed that for a given process, if its steady state gain matrix is not critically D-stable, its DIC can be determined by using its steady state gain matrix. This technical note investigates decentralized integral control with a special focus on the DIC analysis of processes whose steady state gain matrices are critically D-stable. First, we introduce a new unconditional stability criterion. Then, by using the proposed criterion, it is proved that for up to four-channel processes, their DIC can be totally determined by their steady state gain matrices. We also present a multi-loop PI control design method, which provides an explicit lower bound of the proportional coefficient to achieve decentralized unconditional stability for low dimensional processes. For higher dimensional processes, this technical note presents a six-channel process whose DIC property cannot be determined only by its steady state gain matrix, contradicting the view of some other researchers.},

The theoretical properties of the proposed scheme are discussed taking into account standard stability and accuracy analyses, indicating the excellent performance of the new technique. At the end of the contribution, representative nonlinear numerical examples are studied, further illustrating the effectiveness of the new technique.

  volume = {44},
  issn = {0098-8847},
  doi = {10/f65zsp},
  abstract = {In real-time hybrid simulations (RTHS) that utilize explicit integration algorithms, the inherent damping in the analytical substructure is generally defined using mass and initial stiffness proportional damping. This type of damping model is known to produce inaccurate results when the structure undergoes significant inelastic deformations. To alleviate the problem, a form of a nonproportional damping model often used in numerical simulations involving implicit integration algorithms can be considered. This type of damping model, however, when used with explicit integration algorithms can require a small time step to achieve the desired accuracy in an RTHS involving a structure with a large number of degrees of freedom. Restrictions on the minimum time step exist in an RTHS that are associated with the computational demand. Integrating the equations of motion for an RTHS with too large of a time step can result in spurious high-frequency oscillations in the member forces for elements of the structural model that undergo inelastic deformations. The problem is circumvented by introducing the parametrically controllable numerical energy dissipation available in the recently developed unconditionally stable explicit KR- method. This paper reviews the formulation of the KR- method and presents an efficient implementation for RTHS. Using the method, RTHS of a three-story 0.6-scale prototype steel building with nonlinear elastomeric dampers are conducted with a ground motion scaled to the design basis and maximum considered earthquake hazard levels. The results show that controllable numerical energy dissipation can significantly eliminate spurious participation of higher modes and produce exceptional RTHS results.

Furthermore, it is also found that numerical accuracy in the solution of nonlinear systems is closely related to the step degree of nonlinearity and step degree of convergence although its characteristics are similar to those of the preceding works for linear elastic systems.

In this paper, a technique based on linearized analysis is proposed to evaluate the numerical properties of a step-by-step integration method for each time step for both linear and nonlinear systems. For this purpose, two parameters are introduced for each time step. One is used to describe the degree of nonlinearity ( DON) and the other is employed to monitor the degree of convergence (DOC) as an iteration procedure is used. It seems that the proposed evaluation technique can reliably predict the numerical properties of an integration method in the solution of nonlinear systems. Furthermore, a guideline to have accurate solutions of nonlinear systems is proposed and confirmed with numerical examples. Although the evaluation technique is conducted on a time step, it is still indicative for a complete integration procedure since this procedure consists of each time step. It is verified that the constant average acceleration method (CAAM) is spectrally stable for nonlinear systems in a whole integration procedure based on a linearized stability analysis.},

  abstract = {The feasibility of using pseudodynamic techniques to yield shock responses from impulses is studied herein. A direct integration method is often used to solve the force equation of motion in performing a conventional pseudodynamic test. However, this technique might not be applicable to obtain an accurate shock response from an impulse as a load discontinuity occurs at the end of the impulse. This is because this discontinuity will lead to an extra amplitude distortion and the amount of this amplitude distortion is increased with the increase of time step. Hence, a small time step is needed to reduce the extra amplitude distortion and thus the displacement increment for each time step might be smaller than or as small as the resolution of the displacement transducer. As a result, the displacement increment cannot be accurately imposed upon the specimen and the responses will be contaminated by the noise. In addition, the test duration is drastically increased. Alternatively, this difficulty might be overcome if the momentum equation of motion instead of the force equation of motion is solved pseudodynamically. Hence, an external momentum is used in the solution of the momentum equation of motion. Since the external momentum is a resultant of the time integration of the external force the discontinuity problem will automatically disappear. Consequently, reliable shock responses can be obtained from pseudodynamic tests.},

This method has a great stability property when compared to the previously published method [6], which is unconditionally stable for linear elastic and any instantaneous stiffness softening systems while it only has conditional stability for an instantaneous stiffness hardening system. The most important improvement of this method is that it has unconditional stability for general instantaneous stiffness hardening systems in addition to linear elastic and instantaneous stiffness softening systems. This implies that a time step may be selected base on accuracy consideration only and the stability problem might be neglected. Hence, many computational efforts can be saved in the step-by-step solution of a general structural dynamic problem, where the response is dominated by the low frequency modes and the high frequency responses are of no great interest, when compared to an explicit method, such as the Newmark explicit method, and an implicit method, such as the constant average acceleration method.},

  abstract = {The application of a pseudodynamic technique to yield a shock response from an impulse might encounter a difficulty caused by a significant load discontinuity at the end of the impulse since this load discontinuity at the end of an impulse will result in an extra impulse and then an extra amplitude distortion. This extra impulse is linearly proportional to the step size and thus it is natural to consider the use of a very small time step for a whole pseudodynamic test to overcome the difficulty. However, a series of computer simulations reveal that this approach might not be feasible. This is because that the use of a small time step will lead to a very small displacement increment and it may be contaminated by experimental errors as its magnitude is less than or close to the magnitude of the experimental errors Thus, an inaccurate test result is obtained. A technique is proposed to overcome this difficulty. This novel technique is to perform a single small time step immediately upon the termination of the applied impulse while the other time steps are conducted by using the time step determined from general considerations. This single small time step will not lead to a significant error propagation problem since only this time step is performed by using a very small step size for a complete pseudodynamic test. The feasibility of this technique was confirmed by a series of pseudodynamic tests.},

  abstract = {Although the step degree of nonlinearity has been introduced to conduct basic analysis and error propagation analysis for the pseudodynamic testing of nonlinear systems, it cannot be reliably used to select an appropriate time step before performing a pseudodynamic test. Therefore, a novel parameter of instantaneous degree of nonlinearity is introduced to monitor the stiffness change at the end of a time step, and can thus be used to evaluate numerical and error propagation properties for nonlinear systems. Based on these properties, it is possible to select an appropriate time step to conduct a pseudodynamic test in advance. This possibility is very important in pseudodynamic testing, since the use of an arbitrary time step might lead to unreliable results or even destroy the test specimen. In this paper, guidelines are proposed for choosing an appropriate time step for accurate integration of nonlinear systems. These guidelines require estimation of the maximum instantaneous degree of nonlinearity and the solution of the initial natural frequency. The Newmark explicit method is chosen for this study.

Since the initial stiffness matrix determined from an experimental procedure may be different if a different displacement is imposed upon a specified degree of freedom to obtain its corresponding column, the coefficient matrices will vary accordingly. Sensitivity studies of this variation of the coefficient matrices for numerical properties and error propagation properties are conducted herein. It is revealed by both the analytical and numerical results that the performance of the gamma-function explicit pseudodynamic algorithm for both linear elastic and nonlinear systems is insensitive to the variation of the coefficient matrices in the quadrature equation, especially for a small value of the product of the natural frequency and the size of integration time step.},

This remedy is very simple and it involves adjusting the input load at the time instant of discontinuity. In fact, the average of the two discontinuity values at the load discontinuity is taken to be the adjusting input load for the time instant of load discontinuity. The feasibility of this remedy is analytically verified and confirmed with numerical examples not only for impulses but also for dynamic loadings. Apparently, there is no extra computational effort needed for the remedy and it will not complicate the programming of dynamic analysis codes.},

  abstract = {An estimated initial stiffness matrix is generally needed to determine the coefficient matrices of quadrature equations for a structure-dependent pseudodynamic algorithm. It is shown herein that an experimentally determined initial stiffness matrix is, in general, close to the true initial stiffness matrix if an imposed displacement is small enough. This case is often encountered in practice. The case where an estimated initial stiffness is different from a true initial stiffness for employing a structure-dependent pseudodynamic algorithm is also explored. The numerical properties and error propagation properties are evaluated as a function of the initial stiffness ratio, which is the ratio of an estimated initial stiffness over a true initial stiffness. In general, accuracy and error propagation properties are insensitive to the initial stiffness ratio. It seems that the change of bifurcation point between unconditional stability and conditional stability is of worth noting. In order to avoid this stability problem, guidelines are recommended if a structure-dependent pseudodynamic algorithm is used.},

However, it is still unclear about its performance in the solution of nonlinear systems analytically. Hence, this study proposes to analytically investigate its numerical characteristics for solving nonlinear systems. Design/methodology/approach - Two parameters are introduced to facilitate the basic analysis for nonlinear systems. One is the step degree of nonlinearity, which describes the stiffness change within a time step, and the other is the step degree of convergence, which describes the convergence error due to an iteration procedure. Findings - It is theoretically proved that the sub-family of WBZ-alpha method of -1 $<$= alpha $<$ 0, beta = (1/4)(1 - alpha)(2) and gamma = (1/2) - alpha is unconditionally stable and has desired numerical dissipation for any nonlinear systems even with the presence of convergence error. These theoretical results are confirmed by numerical examples. Originality/value - This analytical study reveals that the performance of the WBZ-alpha method for nonlinear systems is in general the same as that for linear elastic systems.},

Stability analysis reveals that the upper stability limit is inversely proportional to the square root of the instantaneous degree of nonlinearity and thus it is no longer equal to 2 for nonlinear systems. In fact, it is shrunk as instantaneous degree of nonlinearity is larger than I while it is enlarged as instantaneous degree of nonlinearity is less than 1. It is also proved that the satisfaction of stability limits for each time step implies a stable computation in the complete step-by-step integration procedure. Accuracy analysis shows that the relative period error is increased with the increase of the instantaneous degree of nonlinearity for a given product of the initial natural frequency and time step. Furthermore, a rough guideline is proposed for accurate integration of nonlinear systems and its appropriateness is confirmed with numerical examples.},

  abstract = {An implementation for the pseudodynamic testing of a one-story frame subject to bidirectional loading was proposed and its feasibility was experimentally verified. Three generalized degrees of freedom at the center of mass of the roof diaphragm are often used in formulating the equations of motion for the one-story frame in a nonplanar test. In this work, three loading points of actuators oriented in the original directions of these actuators were selected to formulate equations of motion. Since loading-point degrees of freedom instead of generalized degrees of freedom were used for a pseudodynamic test there is no need to construct the transformation between these two coordinate systems. Thus, there is no error propagation regarding these transformations. External displacement transducers were applied to measure the displacement components along the original directions of the actuators although the directions of these actuators may vary after the specimen deforms. This displacement measurement is easy to implement and saves a large space in the test setup. A series of pseudodynamic tests were performed and the responses were compared to shaking table tests. These test results attested to that a bidirectional pseudodynamic test can be conducted using the loading-point degrees of freedom and this technique is applicable to the three-dimensional testing of structures under multiple components of earthquake ground motion.},

  abstract = {Although a closed form solution can be obtained for the shock response to an impulse by using the Duhamel integral method for a single degree-of-freedom system, it is analytically verified herein that an extra amplitude distortion will be introduced at the end of the impulse by using the Newmark method.

It seems that the momentum equation of motion can be used to easily overcome the discontinuity problem at the end of an impulse. This is because the external force is replaced by its corresponding external momentum, which is obtained from the time integration of external force, and thus the discontinuity problem automatically disappears by using the momentum equation of motion.

Their numerical properties in the solution of a linear elastic system have been well explored and their applications to the pseudodynamic testing of a nonlinear system have been shown to be feasible.

Therefore, the performance of both algorithms for use in the solution of a nonlinear system has been analytically evaluated after introducing an instantaneous degree of nonlinearity. The two algorithms have roughly the same accuracy for a small value of the product of the natural frequency and step size. Meanwhile, the first algorithm is unconditionally stable when the instantaneous degree of nonlinearity is less than or equal to 1, and it becomes conditionally stable when it is greater than 1. The second algorithm is conditionally stable as the instantaneous degree of nonlinearity is less than 1/9, and becomes unstable when it is greater than 1. It can have unconditional stability for the range between 1/9 and 1. Based on these evaluations, it was concluded that the first algorithm is superior to the second one.

  abstract = {Current accuracy evaluation of a step-by-step integration method is generally based on the numerical solution itself and the exact solution is not referred to except for period distortion. Furthermore, the numerical accuracy associated with external force is generally not considered. In this study, an evaluation technique is proposed to assess the numerical accuracy, including the accuracy associated with a linear step loading type, of the Newmark method by comparing the numerical solution to the exact solution. No errors are found in the steady-state response. Period distortion in the cosine term of the transient response is different from that in the sine term except for the subfamily of gamma = 1/2. A new measure of amplitude distortion is defined that incorporates the error in amplitude relative to the exact solution. This measure can reflect amplitude distortion more realistically in a numerical solution when compared to the current measures of numerical dissipation. In general, period and amplitude distortions are cumulative except that there is no cumulation in amplitude distortion for the subfamily of gamma = 1/2. It is also shown that numerical damping is ineffective for the steady-state response.},

Its unconditional stability is verified only for linear elastic systems, while for nonlinear systems, instability occurs as the step degree of convergence is less than 1. It is worth noting that the step degree of convergence can frequently be less than 1 in pseudodynamic testing, since a convergent solution is achieved only when the step degree of convergence is close to 1 regardless of whether its value is greater or less than 1. Therefore, the application of this scheme to pseudodynamic testing should be prohibited, since the possibility of instability might incorrectly destroy a specimen. Consequently, the implementation of the HHT $\alpha$ method by using the difference equation to determine the next step acceleration is recommended for use in pseudodynamic testing.},

  doi = {10/bx575w},
  abstract = {Two important extensions of a technique to perform a nonlinear error propagation analysis for an explicit pseudodynamic algorithm (Chang, 2003) are presented. One extends the stability study from a given time step to a complete step-by-step integration procedure. It is analytically proven that ensuring stability conditions in each time step leads to a stable computation of the entire step-by-step integration procedure. The other extension shows that the nonlinear error propagation results, which are derived for a nonlinear single degree of freedom (SDOF) system, can be applied to a nonlinear multiple degree of freedom (MDOF) system. This application is dependent upon the determination of the natural frequencies of the system in each time step, since all the numerical properties and error propagation properties in the time step are closely related to these frequencies. The results are derived from the step degree of nonlinearity. An instantaneous degree of nonlinearity is introduced to replace the step degree of nonlinearity and is shown to be easier to use in practice. The extensions can be also applied to the results derived from a SDOF system based on the instantaneous degree of nonlinearity, and hence a time step might be appropriately chosen to perform a pseudodynamic test prior to testing.},

Furthermore, the implementation of an explicit method for the pseudodynamic testing is much simpler than for an implicit method. The superiority of using this method in performing a pseudodynamic test was verified both analytically and experimentally. In fact, results of error propagation analysis reveal that the spurious growth of high frequency responses can be suppressed and less error propagation is identified when compared to the Newmark explicit method. Actual tests were conducted pseudodynamically to confirm all the analytical results. It is also illustrated that although the high frequency response is insignificant to the total response it may be significantly amplified and propagated and finally destroys the pseudodynamic test results.},

Therefore, it seems promising if an explicit pseudodynamic algorithm can have unconditional stability, which will eliminate the severe limitation on a time step for the pseudodynamic testing of a multiple degree of freedom system or a substructure system. Although an unconditionally stable explicit pseudodynamic algorithm (USEPA-1) has been developed by the first author an enhanced unconditionally stable explicit pseudodynamic algorithm (USEPA-2) is further proposed. It is interesting to find that both algorithms have exactly the same numerical properties. However, USEPA-2 possesses better error propagation properties than those of USEPA-1.},

  doi = {10/d4mvcx},
  abstract = {We present in this paper the formulation of a new high-frequency dissipative time-stepping algorithm for nonlinear elastodynamics that is second-order accurate in time. The new scheme exhibits unconditional energy dissipation and momentum conservation (and thus the given name of energy-dissipative, momentum-conserving second-order scheme (EDMC-2)), leading also to the conservation of the relative equilibria of the underlying physical system. The unconditional character of these properties applies not only with respect to the time step size but, equally important, with respect to the considered elastic potential. Moreover, the dissipation properties are fully controlled through an algorithmic parameter, reducing to existing fully conserving schemes, if desired. The design of the new algorithm is described in detail, including a complete analysis of its dissipation/conservation properties in the fully nonlinear range of finite elasticity. To motivate the different constructions that lead to the dissipative properties of the final scheme, the same arguments are used first in the construction of new linear time-stepping algorithms for the system of linear elastodynamics, including first- and second-order schemes. The new schemes exhibit a rigorous decay of the physical energy, with the second-order schemes formulated in a general two-stage formula accommodating the aforementioned control parameter in the dissipation of the energy. A complete spectral analysis of the new schemes is presented in this linear range to evaluate their different numerical properties. In particular, the dissipative character of the proposed schemes in the high-frequency range is fully demonstrated. In fact, it is shown that the new second-order scheme is L-stable. Most remarkably, the extension of these ideas to the nonlinear range is accomplished avoiding the use of multi-stage formulae, given the freedom gained in using general nonlinear relations, while preserving the conservation laws of the momenta and the corresponding relative equilibria. Several representative numerical simulations are presented in the context of nonlinear elastodynamics to evaluate the performance of the newly proposed schemes.},

The possibility of unconditional stability and second-order accuracy allows using a large time step; and the explicitness of each time step involves no iterative procedure.

  abstract = {A new non-iterative implicit algorithm for hybrid simulation, termed the Predictor-Alpha-Corrector (PAC) method, is presented in this study. The PAC method uses the predicted acceleration vector and the updated stiffness matrix of the tested structure to compute the fully-explicit response values. The stability and accuracy characteristics of the PAC method are explored using frequency analysis. It is shown that the PAC method is unconditionally stable when the estimated tangent stiffness used in the algorithm is larger than or equal to the real stiffness of the tested structure. The PAC method is also shown to have desirable numerical damping characteristics due to the \&alpha; parameter introduced in the corrector. The method provides adequate dissipation in the higher modes while guaranteeing that the lower modes are not affected too strongly. Using a linearly elastic single degree-of-freedom model, the PAC method is demonstrated to be able to damp undesired spurious oscillations and limit the amplification of actuator control errors. The performance of the PAC method for hybrid simulation is numerically demonstrated using a steel bridge model. It is shown that this method is capable of simulating the seismic response of the bridge model with reasonable accuracy despite the presence of material nonlinearity and displacement control errors during the process of numerical hybrid simulation. \&copy; 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

To obtain correct reaction inertia force, an explicit acceleration formulation is assumed for the CDM. The analytical work shows that the stability of the algorithm decreases with increasing specimen mass if the experimental substructure is a pure inertia specimen. The algorithm becomes unstable whatever the time integration interval, i.e., unconditionally unstable, when the mass of specimen equal or greater than that of its numerical counterpart. For the case of dynamic specimen, the algorithm is unconditionally unstable when there is no damping in the whole test structure; a damping will make the algorithm stable conditionally. The behavior of the CDM for vanishing time integration interval is verified with the zero-stability analysis method for coupled integration. Part of the analytical results is validated by an actual test. \&copy; 2009 AACC.},

  abstract = {A number of seismic hazard mitigation devices have been recently developed to enhance the seismic performance of structural systems. Many of these devices are load-rate dependent. The development of performance-based earthquake engineering procedures to effectively design structures with these devices requires that their behavior be well understood, accurate analytical models exist, and the design procedure be verified. These requirements can best be met by performing real-time hybrid tests of structural systems with these devices. The Real-Time Multi-Directional (RTMD) Earthquake Simulation NEES Equipment Site at Lehigh University specializes in real-time hybrid testing. This paper presents the development and application of an explicit integration algorithm for real-time testing at the RTMD facility. The algorithm is unconditionally stable for linear and nonlinear softening structures and developed using an innovative approach based on discrete control theory. This paper includes the development of the integration algorithm, its implementation into the real-time integrated control system at the RTMD facility, and its application to the real-time hybrid testing of passive elastomeric dampers. The integration algorithm is shown to be easy to implement and enable exceptional real-time hybrid test results to be acquired. \&copy; 2008 ASCE.},

Implicit schemes, which solve such equations, are unconditionally stable and are thus widely used. Part of this stability is due to force filtering which is inherent to the implicit formulation and is referred to artificial damping. We extract this artificial damping and we analyse frequencies. This analysis enables us to define a non arbitrary damping value and a stability criterion in accordance to filtering. This directly comes from a decrease of velocity vectors' eigenvalues resulting in an increase of the time step in the same proportion. Moreover we applied a simple filtering model reproducing artificial damping to explicit schemes and results reveal an increase of the time step. Implementation of this method is straightforward for existing physically based simulators. Applications to cloth and fish animations are presented. \&copy; The Eurographics Association 2007.},

  issn = {0749159X},
  abstract = {Spurious high-frequency responses resulting from spatial discretization in time-step algorithms for structural dynamic analysis have long been an issue of concern in the framework of traditional finite difference methods. Such algorithms should be not only numerically dissipative in a controllable manner, but also unconditionally stable so that the time-step size can be governed solely by the accuracy requirement. In this article, the issue is considered in the framework of the second-order scheme of the precise integration method (PIM). Taking the Newmark-\&beta; method as a reference, the performance and numerical behavior of the second-order PIM for elasto-dynamic impact-response problems are studied in detail. In this analysis, the differential quadrature method is used for spatial discretization. The effects of spatial discretization, numerical damping, and time step on solution accuracy are explored by analyzing longitudinal vibrations of a shock-excited rod with rectangular, half-triangular, and Heaviside step impact. Both the analysis and numerical tests show that under the framework of the PIM, the spatial discretization used here can provide a reasonable number of model types for any given error tolerance. In the analysis of dynamic response, an appropriate spatial discretization scheme for a given structure is usually required in order to obtain an accurate and meaningful numerical solution, especially for describing the fine details of traction responses with sharp changes. Under the framework of the PIM, the numerical damping that is often required in traditional integration schemes is found to be unnecessary, and there is no restriction on the size of time steps, because the PIM can usually produce results with machine-like precision and is an unconditionally stable explicit method. \&copy;2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {The implicit dissipative generalized- $\alpha$ method is analyzed using discrete control theory. Based on this analysis, a one-parameter family of explicit direct integration algorithms with controllable numerical energy dissipation, referred to as the explicit KR-$\alpha$ method, is developed for linear and nonlinear structural dynamic numerical analysis applications. Stability, numerical dispersion, and energy dissipation characteristics of the proposed algorithms are studied. It is shown that the algorithms are unconditionally stable for linear elastic and stiffness softening-type nonlinear systems, where the latter indicates a reduction in post yield stiffness in the force\textendash{}deformation response. The amount of numerical damping is controlled by a single parameter, which provides a measure of the numerical energy dissipation at higher frequencies. Thus, for a specific value of this parameter, the resulting algorithm is shown to produce no numerical energy dissipation. Furthermore, it is shown that the influence of the numerical damping on the lower mode response is negligible. It is further shown that the numerical dispersion and energy dissipation characteristics of the proposed explicit algorithms are the same as that of the implicit generalized- $\alpha$ method. A numerical example is presented to demonstrate the potential of the proposed algorithms in reducing participation of undesired higher modes by using numerical energy dissipation to damp out these modes.

  doi = {10/f6dgjc},
  abstract = {A new family of explicit integration algorithms is developed based on discrete control theory for solving the dynamic equations of motion. The proposed algorithms are explicit for both displacement and velocity and require no factorisation of the damping matrix and the stiffness matrix. Therefore, for a system with nonlinear damping and stiffness, the proposed algorithms are more efficient than the common explicit algorithms that provide only explicit displacement. Accuracy and stability properties of the proposed algorithms are analysed theoretically and verified numerically. Certain subfamilies are found to be unconditionally stable for any system state (linear elastic, stiffness softening or stiffness hardening) that may occur in earthquake engineering of a practical structure. With dual explicit expression and excellent stability property, the proposed family of algorithms can potentially solve complicated nonlinear dynamic problems.},

Two new families of second-order accurate, dissipative, explicit methods have been successfully developed for the direct integration of equations of motion in structural dynamics. These two families of methods are numerically equivalent and possess the desired numerical dissipation which can be continuously controlled. These two families of algorithms are very useful for pseudodynamic tests since the favourable numerical damping can be used to suppress the spurious growth of high-frequency modes due to the presence of numerical and/or experimental errors in performing a pseudodynamic test. \textcopyright{} 1997 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  issn = {1526-1492},
  abstract = {In this study, we consider Initial Value Problems (IVPs) for strongly nonlinear dynamical systems, and study numerical methods to analyze short as well as long-term responses. Dynamical systems characterized by a system of second-order nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are recast into a system of nonlinear first order ODEs in mixed variables of positions as well as velocities. For each discrete-time interval Radial Basis Functions (RBFs) are assumed as trial functions for the mixed variables in the time domain. A simple collocation method is developed in the time-domain, with Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto nodes as RBF source points as well as collocation points. Three numerical examples are provided to compare the present algorithm with explicit as well implicit methods in terms of accuracy, required size of time-interval (or step) and computational cost. The present algorithm is compared against, the second order central difference method, the classical Runge-Kutta method, the adaptive Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg method, the Newmark-beta and the Hilber-Hughes-Taylor Methods. First the highly nonlinear Duffing oscillator is analyzed and the solutions obtained from all algorithms are compared against the analytical solution for free oscillation at long times. A Duffing oscillator with impact forcing function is next solved. Solutions are compared against numerical solutions from state of the art ODE45 numerical integrator for long times. Finally, a nonlinear 3-DOF system is presented and results from all algorithms are compared against ODE45. It is shown that the present RBF-Coll algorithm is very simple, efficient and very accurate in obtaining the solution for the nonlinear IVP. Since other presented methods require a much smaller step size and higher computational cost, the proposed algorithm is advantageous and has promising applications in solving nonlinear dynamical systems. The extension of the present algorithm to orbit propagation problems with perturbations, will be pursued in our future studies. Issues of numerical stability for various time-integrators will also be explored in future studies.},

  doi = {10/f2dc6q},
  abstract = {A direct time integration method is presented for the solution of the equations of motion describing the dynamic response of structural linear and nonlinear multi-degree-of-freedom systems. It applies also to large systems of second order differential equations with fully populated, non symmetric coefficient matrices as well as to equations with variable coefficients. The proposed method is based on the concept of the analog equation, which converts the coupled N equations into a set of single term uncoupled second order ordinary quasi-static differential equations under appropriate fictitious loads, unknown in the first instance. The fictitious loads are established from the integral representation of the solution of the substitute single term equations. The method is simple to implement. It is self starting, unconditionally stable and accurate and conserves energy. It performs well when large deformations and long time durations are considered and it can be used as a practical method for integration of the equations of motion in cases where widely used time integration procedures, e. g. Newmark's, become unstable. Several examples are presented, which demonstrate the efficiency of the method. The method can be straightforward extended to evolution equations of order higher than two.

  doi = {10/f7c6t2},
  abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to report the implementation of an alternative time integration procedure for the dynamic non-linear analysis of structures. Design/methodology/approach - The time integration algorithm discussed in this work corresponds to a spectral decomposition technique implemented in the time domain. As in the case of the modal decomposition in space, the numerical efficiency of the resulting integration scheme depends on the possibility of uncoupling the equations of motion. This is achieved by solving an eigenvalue problem in the time domain that only depends on the approximation basis being implemented. Complete sets of orthogonal Legendre polynomials are used to define the time approximation basis required by the model. Findings - A classical example with known analytical solution is presented to validate the model, in linear and non-linear analysis. The efficiency of the numerical technique is assessed. Comparisons are made with the classical Newmark method applied to the solution of both linear and non-linear dynamics. The mixed time integration technique presents some interesting features making very attractive its application to the analysis of non-linear dynamic systems. It corresponds in essence to a modal decomposition technique implemented in the time domain. As in the case of the modal decomposition in space, the numerical efficiency of the resulting integration scheme depends on the possibility of uncoupling the equations of motion. Originality/value - One of the main advantages of this technique is the possibility of considering relatively large time step increments which enhances the computational efficiency of the numerical procedure. Due to its characteristics, this method is well suited to parallel processing, one of the features that have to be conveniently explored in the near future.},

The work is divided into three parts, each containing a chapter dealing with a particular problem type as well as a very short section of hints to select problems. The first chapter collects problems on limits of special sequences and Riemann integrals; the second chapter focuses on the calculation of fractional part integrals with a special section called `Quickies' which contains problems that have had unexpected succinct solutions. The final chapter offers the reader an assortment of problems with a flavor towards the computational aspects of infinite series and special products, many of which are new to the literature. Each chapter contains a section of difficult problems which are motivated by other problems in the book. These `Open Problems' may be considered research projects for students who are studying advanced calculus, and which are intended to stimulate creativity and the discovery of new and original methods for proving known results and establishing new ones. This stimulating collection of problems is intended for undergraduate students with a strong background in analysis; graduate students in mathematics, physics, and engineering; researchers; and anyone who works on topics at the crossroad between pure and applied mathematics.

They cover the following subjects: set theory; real numbers; sequences; limits of the functions; continuity; differentiability; integration; series; metric spaces; sequences; and series of functions and fundamentals of topology. Furthermore, the authors define the concepts and cite the theorems used at the beginning of each chapter.

  abstract = {It was recently shown in a series of papers that the frequency response of temporally discretized finite element equations and, consequently, the achievable accuracy cannot be manipulated independently in different frequency ranges. In addition, there exist limitations on the achievable accuracy of a time integration method no matter what the order of accuracy of the method is. Motivated by this fact, a family of time integration methods is derived in the time domain based on the principle that the exact solution of the semidiscrete equation of a system and the solution of the time integration method match at discrete time steps. It is necessary to pursue an exact match at discrete time steps, i.e. discrete equivalence, since the solutions of semidiscrete equations are obtained only at the time steps. Two time integration methods, that are exact at the time steps, are obtained based on the impulse and ramp response invariance principles. Numerical examples are presented to show the advantage of the proposed methods and to compare the performance of them with the performance of some popular methods.

  abstract = {In this paper, the discrete generalized Bode's theorem is derived and applied to the transfer functions of time integration algorithms for semidiscrete finite element equations. An integral equation is obtained that has to be satisfied by discrete-time transfer functions of time integration algorithms. Subsequently, the frequency response of temporally discretized finite element equations and the achievable accuracy cannot be manipulated independently in different frequency ranges. However, there is a tradeoff in low and high frequency behavior of time integration algorithms. A characteristic gain that complements the role of the spectral radius of the amplification matrix is derived to quantify the asymptotic mode annihilation capability of the algorithms. As shown, the characteristic gain helps to compare different time integration algorithms. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the role of the proposed characteristic gain.},

The present paper overcomes this limitation by introducing a new class of numerical integrators, called the LLT method, that is based on the addition of a correction term to the LL approximation. In this way an arbitrary order of convergence can be achieved while retaining the dynamic properties of the LL method. In particular, it is proved that the LLT method reproduces correctly the phase portrait of a dynamical system near hyperbolic stationary points to the order of convergence.

The derivation of the algorithm is based on a reformulation of the parameterization as a linear parameter-free ordinary differential equation and on approximating the product of the matrix exponential and a vector with a Krylov method. The Krylov approximation is generated with Arnoldi's method and the structure of the coefficient matrix turns out to be independent of the truncation parameter so that it can also be interpreted as Arnoldi's method applied to an infinite dimensional matrix. We prove the super linear convergence of the algorithm and provide a posteriori error estimates to be used as termination criteria. The behavior of the algorithm is illustrated with examples stemming from spatial discretizations of partial differential equations. \&copy; 2016 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.},

  abstract = {Krylov subspace methods have proved quite effective at approximating the action of a large sparse matrix exponential on a vector. Their numerical robustness and matrix-free nature have enabled them to make inroads into a variety of applications. A case in point is solving the chemical master equation (CME) in the context of modeling biochemical reactions in biological cells. This is a challenging problem that gives rise to an extremely large matrix due to the curse of dimensionality. Inexact Krylov subspace methods that build on truncation techniques have helped solve some CME models that were considered computationally out of reach as recently as a few years ago. However, as models grow, truncating them means using an even smaller fraction of their whole extent, thereby introducing more inexactness. But experimental evidence suggests an apparent success and the aim of this study is to give theoretical insights into the reasons why. Essentially, we show that the truncation can be put in the framework of inexact Krylov methods that relax matrix-vector products and compute them expediently by trading accuracy for speed. This allows us to analyze both the residual (or defect) and the error of the resulting approximations to the matrix exponential from the viewpoint of inexact Krylov methods. \&copy; 2017 International Association for Mathematics and Computers in Simulation (IMACS).},

  abstract = {In this paper a new method for computing the action of the matrix exponential on a vector e\textsuperscript{At}b, where A is a complex matrix and t is a positive real number, is proposed. Our approach is based on vector valued rational approximation where the approximants are determined by the denominator polynomials whose coefficients are obtained by solving an inexpensive linear least-squares problem. No matrix multiplications or divisions but matrix-vector products are required in the whole process. A technique of scaling and recurrence enables our method to be more effective when the problem is for fixed A,b and many values of t. We also give a backward error analysis in exact arithmetic for the truncation errors to derive our new algorithm. Preliminary numerical results illustrate that the new algorithm performs well. \&copy; 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

As a side result, we obtain error bounds for Galerkin-type Krylov methods for linear equations, namely, the biconjugate gradient method and the full orthogonalization method. For Krylov approximations to matrix exponentials, we show superlinear error decay from relatively small iteration numbers onwards, depending on the geometry of the numerical range, the spectrum, or the pseudospectrum. The convergence to exp(\&tau; A)v is faster than that of corresponding Krylov methods for the solution of linear equations (I -\&tau;A)x = v, which usually arise in the numerical solution of stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We therefore propose a new class of time integration methods for large systems of nonlinear differential equations which use Krylov approximations to the exponential function of the Jacobian instead of solving linear or nonlinear systems of equations in every time step.},

An interesting application of this method is the computation of the matrix exponential exp(-\&tau;A)v. This vector plays an important role in the solution of parabolic equations where A results from some form of discretization of an elliptic operator. In the present paper we will argue that for these applications the convergence behavior of this method can be unsatisfactory. We will propose a modified method that resolves this by a simple preconditioned transformation at the cost of an inner-outer iteration. A priori error bounds are presented that are independent of the norm of A. This shows that the worst case convergence speed is independent of the mesh width in the spatial discretization of the elliptic operator. We discuss, furthermore, a posteriori error estimation and the tuning of the coupling between the inner and outer iteration. We conclude with several numerical experiments with the proposed method. \&copy; 2006 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.},

As a new approach, rational approximation based on quadrature formulas derived from complex contour integrals is proposed, which forms an attractive alternative to CRAM, as its coefficients are easy to compute for any order of approximation. This gives the user the option to routinely choose between computational efficiency and accuracy all the way up to the level permitted by the available arithmetic precision. The presented results for two test cases are validated against reference solutions computed using high-precision arithmetics. The observed behavior of the methods confirms the previous conclusions of CRAM's excellent suitability for burnup calculations and establishes the quadrature-based approximation as a viable and flexible alternative that, like CRAM, has its foundation in the specific eigenvalue properties of burnup matrices.},

  abstract = {Recent trends in hydrocarbon fuel research indicate that the number of species and reactions in chemical kinetic mechanisms is rapidly increasing in an effort to provide predictive capabilities for fuels of practical interest. In order to cope with the computational cost associated with the time integration of stiff, large chemical systems, a novel approach is proposed. The approach combines an exponential integrator and Krylov subspace approximations to the exponential function of the Jacobian matrix. The components of the approach are described in detail and applied to the ignition of stoichiometric methane-air and iso-octane-air mixtures, here described by two widely adopted chemical kinetic mechanisms. The approach is found to be robust even at relatively large time steps and the global error displays a nominal third-order convergence. The performance of the approach is improved by utilising an adaptive algorithm for the selection of the Krylov subspace size, which guarantees an approximation to the matrix exponential within user-defined error tolerance. The Krylov projection of the Jacobian matrix onto a low-dimensional space is interpreted as a local model reduction with a well-defined error control strategy. Finally, the performance of the approach is discussed with regard to the optimal selection of the parameters governing the accuracy of its individual components. \&copy; 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

  abstract = {Abstract An unusual amplitude growth in the steady-state response of a high frequency mode for a structure-dependent integration method is numerically and analytically identified. This is a brand new type of amplitude growth and it has never been found in the conventional integration methods. The root cause of this unusual amplitude growth can be revealed by examining the local truncation error constructed from a forced vibration error, where the dominant error term for high frequency modes plays the key role for this unusual amplitude growth. An effective remedy is proposed by introducing a load-dependent term into the difference equation for displacement and/or velocity increment to remove the dominant error term. As a result, this adverse amplitude growth can be automatically removed. Consequently, the inclusion of the load-dependent term in the formulation of the difference equation for displacement increment and/or velocity increment is inevitable for a general structure-dependent integration method.},

  doi = {10/f9hkbm},
  abstract = {A comprehensive study of the two sub-steps composite implicit time integration scheme for the structural dynamics is presented in this paper. A framework is proposed for the convergence accuracy analysis of the generalized composite scheme. The local truncation errors of the acceleration, velocity, and displacement are evaluated in a rigorous procedure. The presented and proved accuracy condition enables the displacement, velocity, and acceleration achieving second-order accuracy simultaneously, which avoids the drawback that the acceleration accuracy may not reach second order. The different influences of numerical frequencies and time step on the accuracy of displacement, velocity, and acceleration are clarified. The numerical dissipation and dispersion and the initial magnitude errors are investigated physically, which measure the errors from the algorithmic amplification matrix's eigenvalues and eigenvectors, respectively. The load and physically undamped/damped cases are naturally accounted. An optimal algorithm-Bathe composite method ( Bathe and Baig, 2005; Bathe, 2007; Bathe and Noh, 2012) is revealed with unconditional stability, no overshooting in displacement, velocity, and acceleration, and excellent performance compared with many other algorithms. The proposed framework also can be used for accuracy analysis and design of other multi-sub-steps composite schemes and single-step methods under physical damping and/or loading.

  abstract = {Abstract Two Chang-$\alpha$ dissipative family methods and two KR-$\alpha$ family methods were developed for time integration recently. Although the four family methods are in the category of the dissipative structure-dependent integration methods, their performances may be drastically different due to the detrimental property of weak instability or overshoot for the two KR-$\alpha$ family methods. This weak instability or overshoot will result in an adverse overshooting behavior or even numerical instability. In general, the four family methods can possess very similar numerical properties, such as unconditional stability, second-order accuracy, explicit formulation and controllable numerical damping. However, the two KR-$\alpha$ family methods are found to possess a weak instability property or overshoot in the high frequency responses to any nonzero initial conditions and thus this property will hinder them from practical applications. Whereas, the two Chang-$\alpha$ dissipative family methods have no such an adverse property. As a result, the performances of the two Chang-$\alpha$ dissipative family methods are much better than for the two KR-$\alpha$ family methods. Analytical assessments of all the four family methods are conducted in this work and numerical examples are used to confirm the analytical predictions.},

This include the theoretical evaluation and comparison of the capability to capture the rapid changes of dynamic loading if using the constant average acceleration method and its integral form and the exploration of the superiority of the time integration to reduce the linearization error.

  doi = {10/fcq443},
  abstract = {Real-time hybrid simulation is a viable experiment technique to evaluate the performance of structures equipped with rate-dependent seismic devices when subject to dynamic loading. The integration algorithm used to solve the equations of motion has to be stable and accurate to achieve a successful real-time hybrid simulation. The implicit HHT a-algorithm is a popular integration algorithm for conducting structural dynamic time history analysis because of its desirable properties of unconditional stability for linear elastic structures and controllable numerical damping for high frequencies. The implicit form of the algorithm, however, requires iterations for nonlinear structures, which is undesirable for real-time hybrid simulation. Consequently, the HHT a-algorithm has been implemented for real-time hybrid simulation using a fixed number of substep iterations. The resulting HHT a-algorithm with a fixed number of substep iterations is believed to be unconditionally stable for linear elastic structures, but research on its stability and accuracy for nonlinear structures is quite limited. In this paper, a discrete transfer function approach is utilized to analyze the HHT a-algorithm with a fixed number of substep iterations. The algorithm is shown to be unconditionally stable for linear elastic structures, but only conditionally stable for nonlinear softening or hardening structures. The equivalent damping of the algorithm is shown to be almost the same as that of the original HHT a-algorithm, while the period elongation varies depending on the structural nonlinearity and the size of the integration time-step. A modified form of the algorithm is proposed to improve its stability for use in nonlinear structures. The stability of the modified algorithm is demonstrated to be enhanced and have an accuracy that is comparable to that of the existing HHT a-algorithm with a fixed number of substep iterations. Both numerical and real-time hybrid simulations are conducted to verify the modified algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the modified algorithm for real-time testing.

Analytical results show that the direct implementation of the subfamily of HHT-伪 method is inappropriate for the pseudodynamic testing although it possesses desired numerical dissipation. However, it is found that the error propagation of high frequency responses can be effectively suppressed by numerical dissipation for the improved implementation of this subfamily of integration methods. Furthermore, the error amplification factor for the improved implementation highly depends on the number of remaining time steps to be performed and the spectral radius of the amplification matrix. In fact, a small spectral radius and/or a large number of remaining time steps will lead to a small error amplification factor. This means an error introduced in an early time step will contribute less to the cumulative error at the end of the test as compared to an error introduced in a later time step.},

  doi = {10/fnnjdw},
  abstract = {The popular Newmark algorithm, used for implicit direct integration of structural dynamics, is extended by means of a nodal partition to permit use of different timesteps in different regions of a structural model. The algorithm developed has as a special case an explicit-explicit subcycling algorithm previously reported by Belytschko, Yen and Mullen. That algorithm has been shown, in the absence of damping or other energy dissipation, to exhibit instability over narrow timestep ranges that become narrower as the number of degrees of freedom increases, making them unlikely to be encountered in practice. The present algorithm avoids such instabilities in the case of a one to two timestep ratio (two subcycles), achieving unconditional stability in an exponential sense for a linear problem. However, with three or more subcycles, the trapezoidal rule exhibits stability that becomes conditional, falling towards that of the central difference method as the number of subcycles increases. Instabilities over narrow timestep ranges, that become narrower as the model size increases, also appear with three or more subcycles. However by moving the partition between timesteps one row of elements into the region suitable for integration with the larger timestep these the unstable timestep ranges become extremely narrow, even in simple systems with a few degrees of freedom. As well, accuracy is improved. Use of a version of the Newmark algorithm that dissipates high frequencies minimises or eliminates these narrow bands of instability. Viscous damping is also shown to remove these instabilities, at the expense of having more effect on the low frequency response.},

The results obtained with this testing method can be strongly corrupted by the spurious propagation of experimental errors. The alpha-operator splitting (alpha-OS) scheme, a convenient linearisation of the so-called alpha-method, is a non-iterative implicit time integration scheme. As such, it is a good candidate for PSD testing since it provides the unconditional stability sometimes needed when the number of d.o.f. is large, while preserving the implementation simplicity of explicit schemes. The properties of the alpha-OS scheme are presented with special emphasis on its error propagation characteristics. These properties are compared with the ones of corresponding iterative implicit schemes. It is shown in particular that, in contrast with what is observed using iterative schemes, the selective damping possibility associated with the or factor become a crucial ingredient for the success of the alpha-OS scheme.

This paper is concerned with the extension of these results to incorporate completely general non-linear dynamic response. Of special interest here is the dynamics of very flexible shells undergoing large overall motion which conserves the total linear and angular momentum and, for the Hamiltonian case, the total energy. A main goal of this paper is the design of non-linear time-stepping algorithms, and the construction of finite element interpolations, which preserve exactly these fundamental constants of motion. It is shown that only a very special class of algorithms, namely a formulation of the mid-point rule in conservation form, exactly preserves the total linear and angular momentum. For the Hamiltonian case, a somewhat surprising result is proved: regardless of the degree of non-linearity in the stored-energy function, a generalized mid-point rule algorithm always exists which exactly conserves energy The conservation properties of a time-stepping algorithm need not, and in general will not, be preserved by the spatial discretization. Precise conditions which ensure preservation of these conservation properties are derived. A number of numerical simulations are presented which illustrate the exact conservation properties of the proposed methodology.},

Investigators often match communities on demographic variables in order to improve the power of their studies. Matching is known to improve power in certain circumstances. However, we show here that if the number of communities is small, the matched design will probably have less power than the unmatched design. This is due primarily to the loss of degrees of freedom in the matched design, which outweighs the benefits of matching on any but the strongest correlates of changes in behaviour. In the community intervention situation, even small differences in sample size between the matched and unmatched analyses can have expensive consequences.},

By a trial and error procedure, at least 16 families of spline curves with different locations of p and q nodal points can be found to meet the requirements of unconditional stability. The accuracy of each family is dependent on the order of the spline and the locations of the nodal points. The 16 families of spline curves supply a wide range of accuracy that can be selected easily. It can be shown that the well-known Wilson-method and the Houbolt method are special cases of the present spline approximations.},

  abstract = {New theoretical ideas and developments describing the fundamental underlying basis for formulating a general family of time discretization operators for first-order parabolic systems emanating from the framework of a generalized time weighted philosophy are first presented which can be broadly classified as pertaining to Type 1, Type 2 and Type 3 family of time discretization operators. As a consequence, the evolution including the clear distinction and the bridging of the relationships between time operators termed as integral operators to the so-called integration operators in time are theoretically developed and demonstrated. The present developments seem to not only provide avenues leading to new algorithms for transient analysis but also provide generalizations and framework to recover a wide variety of existing algorithms. Consequently, under the umbrella of the present framework, a variety of plausible new approaches for generating Nth-order accurate time discretization operators from approximations introduced to Type 1 integral operators in time are first described followed by the developments systematically leading to Type 2 time discretization operators, and subsequently to a wide class of Type 3 time integration operators including the recovery of a variety of known existing time integration operators which can be uniquely identified by Discrete Numerically Assigned (DNA) algorithmic markers. Of the various developments, of noteworthy mention and emphasis here are a new family of L-stable Nth-order Integration Operators (LNInO) of Type 2 for transient computations. Subsequently, some practically useful second-order forms are specifically illustrated and highlighted. The stability and accuracy characteristics are also described for a variety of generated algorithms applicable for transient heat transfer computations. Although the primary focus is on the theoretical developments encompassing linear operators, some simple numerical examples are finally demonstrated to merely illustrate the salient features of the proposed developments.

Some unusual modes of behaviour, which are of substantial interest, have been observed. In the first case, a stable but chaotic solution is found. In the second case, while a stable solution is obtained with a certain time step, an unstable solution is found by decreasing the time step. In the third case, instability is triggered by neglecting the initial acceleration. A simple modification of the Newmark scheme is proposed which keeps the energy constant for the equation {\"u} + P(u) = 0 and thereby guarantees unconditional stability.

  abstract = {A new finite element algorithm for solving elastic and elastoplastic coupled consolidation problems is described. The procedure treats the governing consolidation relations as a system of first-order differential equations and is based on the backward Euler and Thomas and Gladwell schemes with automatic subincrementation of a prescribed series of time increments. The prescribed time increments, which are called coarse time steps, serve to start the procedure and are chosen by the user. The automatic consolidation algorithm attempts to select the time subincrements such that, for a given mesh, the time-stepping (or temporal discretisation) error in the displacements lies close to a specified tolerance.Unlike existing solution techniques, the new algorithm computes not only the displacements and pore pressures, but also their derivatives with respect to time. These extra variables permit a family of unconditionally stable integration algorithms to be constructed which automatically provide an estimate of the local truncation error for each time step. This error estimate is inexpensive to compute and may be used to develop a simple and efficient automatic time stepping mechanism. For the elastic case, the displacements and pore pressures at the end of each subincrement may be solved directly without the need for iteration. For elastoplastic behaviour, however, the governing relationships are non-linear and a system of non-linear equations must be solved to compute the updates.

A class of time-stepping schemes is introduced and their behaviour when applied to a specific problem is analyzed. The aim is to achieve an adequate modelling of the water-oil interface and to preserve reasonable values of the capillary pressure. A technique to clustering the mesh around the interface is used to improved the modelling, and a boundary condition based on the relative mobilities of the two fiuids is imposed to enable the program to calculate the water-oil ratio after breakthrough. The effect of lumping the mass matrix is then examined with a view to reducting the surge in the values obtained for the capillary pressure. Finally an optimum method is suggested for use as a starting algorithm for more sophisticated time-stepping schemes.},

  abstract = {The long-term dynamic response of non-linear geometrically exact rods under-going finite extension, shear and bending, accompanied by large overall motions, is addressed in detail. The central objective is the design of unconditionally stable time-stepping algorithms which exactly preserve fundamental constants of the motion such as the total linear momentum, the total angular momentum and, for the Hamiltonian case, the total energy. This objective is accomplished in two steps. First, a class of algorithms is introduced which conserves linear and angular momentum. This result holds independently of the definition of the algorithmic stress resultants. Second, an algorithmic counterpart of the elastic constitutive equations is developed such that the law of conservation of total energy is exactly preserved. Conventional schemes exhibiting no numerical dissipation, symplectic algorithms in particular, are shown to lead to unstable solutions when the high frequencies are not resolved. Compared to conventional schemes there is little, if any, additional computational cost involved in the proposed class of energy\textendash{}momentum methods. The excellent performance of the new algorithm in comparison to other standard schemes is demonstrated in several numerical simulations.},

The new approach is analyzed and tested in the context of inexact Newton methods but is also well suited to be applied in the pseudo-transient continuation framework. To validate the strategy and assess its gains in terms of computational costs we seek approximate solutions of the incompressible Navier\textendash{}Stokes equations at high-Reynolds numbers. In particular we consider the well known 2D lid-driven cavity flow and backward-facing step problem focusing on the efficiency of the time marching strategy. Residual history and computation time are monitored and compared with many fixed and adaptive forcing term choices of reference.},

In this article, the accuracy of the interpolated solutions within the time interval is investigated by making a comparison with the exact solutions. It is found that the order of accuracy for both the Bubnov-Galerkin method and the Petrov-Galerkin method is, in general, m only within the time interval under consideration. It is also found that there are some locations with one order higher in accuracy. Besides, it is shown that for the Petrov-Galerkin method to maintain higher order accuracy at the end of the time interval, the excitation should be accurate up to order 2m.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new framework to construct higher-order accurate time-step integration algorithms based on weakly enforcing the differential/integral relation. The dependent variable and its time derivatives are assumed to be polynomials of equal order. A differential equation is then transformed into an algebraic equation directly. The main issue is how to approximate the integral of a polynomial by another polynomial of the same degree. Various methods to determine the optimal representation (or projection) are considered. It is shown that to reproduce numerical results equivalent to the Pad{\'e} or generalized Pad{\'e} approximations, the coefficients of the optimal polynomial representation are related to the weighting parameters derived previously for time-step integration algorithms with predetermined coefficients. A special feature for the present formulation is that the same procedure can be used to solve first-, second-, and even higher-order non-homogeneous initial value problems in a unified manner. The resultant algorithms are higher-order accurate and unconditionally A-stable with controllable numerical dissipation. It is also shown that for the numerical results to maintain higher-order accuracy at the end of a time interval, the higher-order terms in the excitation have to be projected as polynomials of lower degree within the present framework as well. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the validity of the present formulations.},

The low-cost, automatic detection of oscillatory behavior, the determination of its period, and methods for its subsequent efficient integration are addressed here, along with stiffness detection. In the first phase, the method for oscillatory problems discussed examines the output of any integrator to determine if the output is nearly periodic. At the point this answer is positive, the second phase is entered and an automatic, nonstiff, multirevolutionary method is invoked. This requires the occasional solution of a nearly periodic initial-value problem over one period by a standard method and the re-determination of its period. Because the multirevolutionary method uses a very large step, the problem has a high probability of being stiff in this second phase. Hence, it is important to detect if stiffness is present so that an appropriate stiff, multirevolutionary method can be selected. 6 figures.},

Also we bring out the relationship (and in some cases equivalence) of these methods to others proposed in the literature. In particular, we show that the methods proposed by the above authors are essentially equivalent to well-known methods of long standing, namely Pad茅 approximant methods for equivalent first-order systems of ordinary differential equations.},

A notion of stability in energy is defined which guarantees that for small time steps energy is asymptotically conserved and for large time steps amplification of higher modes does not occur. By way of the energy identity, the average acceleration method is proved to be stable in that sense.

The goal of this work is the systematic design of conserving algorithms that preserve exactly the conservation laws of momentum and inherit the property of positive dissipation for any step-size. In particular, within the specific context of elastodynamics, a second order accurate algorithm is presented that exhibits exact conservation of both total (linear and angular) momentum and total energy. This scheme is shown to be amenable to a completely straightforward ( Galerkin) finite element implementation and ideally suited for long-term/large-scale simulations. The excellent performance of the method relative to conventional time-integrators is conclusively demonstrated in numerical simulations exhibiting large strains coupled with a large overall rigid motion.},

Nevertheless, the mechanisms leading to their generation are not elucidated. We performed microarray analysis to identify genes involved in EMP release by the endothelial cell line HMEC-1 in response to thrombin. We identified a group of genes linked to the cytoskeleton reorganization family. Among these, the Rho-kinase ROCK-II presented a high transcription rate. ROCK-I, another Rho-kinase isoform, was not modulated by thrombin. Pharmacologic inhibition of Rho-kinases or specific depletion of ROCK-II by short interfering (si) RNA inhibited thrombin-induced EMP release. In contrast, ROCK-I mRNA silencing did not modify EMP generation by thrombin. Exposure of HMEC-1 to thrombin in presence of the caspase-2 selective inhibitor Z-VDVAD-FMK prevented ROCK-II cleavage and inhibited the thrombin-induced EMP release. These events were observed in absence of cell death. Our data clearly identified ROCK-II as a target of thrombin in EMP generation. They indicated that the 2 Rho-kinases did not share identical functions. The involvement of caspase-2 in ROCK-II activation independently of cell death points out a novel signaling pathway that emphasizes the proteolytic activity of caspase in EMP generation in response to cell activation.},

By taking steps of diminishing height, an approximating sequence of energies is generated. The trajectories of the resulting approximating Lagrangians can be characterized explicitly and consist of intervals of piecewise rectilinear motion. We show that the energy-stepping trajectories are symplectic, exactly conserve all the momentum maps of the original system and, subject to a transversality condition, converge to trajectories of the original system when the energy step is decreased to zero. These properties, the excellent long-term behavior of energy-stepping and its automatic time-step selection property, are born out by selected examples of application, including the dynamics of a frozen Argon cluster, the spinning of an elastic cube and the collision of two elastic spheres.

The conditional stability of the kinematic formulation is the counterpart of the locking phenomenon in elastostatics and may be avoided, either by reduced order integration, or by utilizing a mixed formulation. Toward this end, a two-field mixed formulation is presented, which follows from the general form, when the constitutive relations are satisfied a priori .

First, we demonstrate analytically that the classical Newmark family as well as related integration algorithms are variational in the sense of the Veselov formulation of discrete mechanics. Such variational algorithms are well known to be symplectic and momentum preserving and to often have excellent global energy behaviour. This analytical result is verified through numerical examples and is believed to be one of the primary reasons that this class of algorithms performs so well. Second, we develop algorithms for mechanical systems with forcing, and in particular, for dissipative systems. In this case, we develop integrators that are based on a discretization of the Lagrange d'Alembert principle as well as on a variational formulation of dissipation. It is demonstrated that these types of structured integrators have good numerical behaviour in terms of obtaining the correct amounts by which the energy changes over the integration run.

Holonomic as well nonholonomic constraints, that may exist on the motion of the rigid body, are introduced into this weak form in a fundamentally novel fashion here. Comments are made on the incremental form (and consistent linearization) of the weak formulation (with constraints), and the time-finite-element solutions thereof.},

  volume = {9},
  abstract = {This paper presents a two-field mixed finite element formulation in the time domain. Several strategies are presented by which the variational formulations are produced. One strategy is based on Hamilton's law, and is suitable for problems where the mechanical energy of the system is given. Another strategy uses the Galerkin method, which is suitable when the equations of motion are given. This strategy can either be based on a continuous or discontinuous approximation of the physical variables in time. All formulations were analyzed, and their characteristics in terms of truncation error (phase and amplitude) and stability are presented. This analysis was verified by numerical results. Comparison of many formulations leads to the conclusion that discontinuous mixed finite element method in the time domain is superior to all others in terms of stability and accuracy.},

  volume = {89},
  abstract = {A simple explicit\textendash{}implicit finite element tearing and interconnecting (FETI) algorithm (AFETI-EI algorithm) is presented for partitioned transient analysis of linear structural systems. The present algorithm employs two decompositions. First, the total system is partitioned via spatial or domain decomposition to obtain the governing equations of motions for each partitioned domain. Second, for each partitioned subsystem, the governing equations are modally decomposed into the rigid-body and deformational equations. The resulting rigid-body equations are integrated by an explicit integrator, for its stability is not affected by step-size restriction on account of zero-frequency contents ($\omega$ = 0). The modally decomposed partitioned deformation equations of motion are integrated by an unconditionally stable implicit integration algorithm. It is shown that the present AFETI-EI algorithm exhibits unconditional stability and that the resulting interface problem possesses the same solution matrix profile as the basic FETI static problems. The present simple dynamic algorithm, as expected, falls short of the performance of the FETI-DP but offers a similar performance of implicit two-level FETI-D algorithm with a much cheaper coarse solver; hence, its simplicity may offer relatively easy means for conducting parallel analysis of both static and dynamic problems by employing the same basic scalable FETI solver, especially for research-mode numerical experiments.

  title = {Heterogeneous Asynchronous Time Integrators for Computational Structural Dynamics},
  volume = {102},
  abstract = {Summary Computational structural dynamics plays an essential role in the simulation of linear and nonlinear systems. Indeed, the characteristics of the time integration procedure have a critical impact on the feasibility of the calculation. In order to go beyond the classical approach (a unique time integrator and a unique timescale), the pioneer approach of Belytschko and co-workers consisted in developing mixed implicit鈥揺xplicit time integrators for structural dynamics. In a first step, the implementation and stability analyses of partitioned integrators with one time step have been achieved for a large class of time integrators. In a second step, the implementation and stability analyses of partitioned integrators with different time steps were studied in detail for particular cases. However, stability results involving different time steps and different time integrators in different parts of the mesh is still an open question in the general case for structural dynamics. The aim of this paper is to propose a state-of-the art of heterogeneous (different time schemes) asynchronous (different time steps) time integrators (HATI) for computational structural dynamics. Finally, an alternative approach based on energy considerations (with velocity continuity at the interface) is proposed in order to develop a general class of HATI for structural dynamics.

Moreover, in case of two-dimensional propagation following contributions are made: (c) we have found optimal value of CFL number for all angles in case of both SFE and MFE schemes; (d) superior dispersive behaviour is evident in case of MFE scheme in comparison with SFE scheme. Furthermore, the MFE scheme can be efficiently implemented using non-standard quadrature rules or just updating mass matrix which does not require to write brand new code and makes it computationally very attractive. Also for specific value of parameter, i.e. $\tau$ = 0, the MFE scheme leads back to the SFE scheme.},

  abstract = {This thesis intends to contribute to the computational methods for wave propagations. We review an implicit time integration method, the Bathe method, that remains stable without the use of adjustable parameters when the commonly used trapezoidal rule results in unstable solutions. We then focus on additional important attributes of the scheme. We present dispersion properties of the Bathe method and show that its desired characteristics for structural dynamics are also valuable for wave propagation problems. A dispersion analysis using the CFL number is given and the solution of some benchmark problems show that the scheme is a method for general use for structural dynamics and wave propagations. Finally, we propose a new explicit time integration method for the analysis of wave propagation problems. The scheme has been formulated using a sub-step within a time step to achieve desired numerical damping to suppress undesirable spurious oscillations of high frequencies. With the optimal CFL number, the method uses about 10\% more solution effort as the standard central difference scheme but significantly improves the solution accuracy and a non-diagonal damping matrix can directly be included. The stability, accuracy and numerical dispersion are analyzed, and solutions to problems are given that illustrate the performance of the scheme.

  doi = {10/f6fbqx},
  abstract = {The primary purpose of this paper is to develop novel fast dynamic methods for large-scale problems of structural dynamics at the least computational efforts. The explicit method of double time steps (EMDTS) is proposed through integration with the assumption of linear acceleration in two time steps. The corrected explicit method of double time steps (CEMDTS) is obtained after correcting the EMDTS. The analyses of stability, accuracy, numerical dissipation and dispersion are performed on the proposed methods. Finally, both linear and nonlinear numerical examples are utilised for the comparison of the two new methods and the established methods. The results show that the EMDTS is unstable in undamped linear systems; however, the CEMDTS has a nondissipative property and the same stability condition as the explicit central difference method (ECDM). The amplitude error of the EMDTS is greater than that of the CEMDTS and the ECDM when the time step is large. The CEMDTS possesses excellent comprehensive properties with less damping ratio error and periodic error than the ECDM in the case of small time steps at almost the same computational efforts. Three numerical examples manifest that the CEMDTS is better than the EMDTS, and endowed with good accuracy and stable properties.},

If the different time scales are localised to different components, corresponding to localisation in space for a PDE, efficient time integration thus requires that we use different time steps for different components. We present an overview of the multi-adaptive Galerkin methods mcG(q) and mdG(q) recently introduced in a series of papers by the author. In these methods, the time step sequence is selected individually and adaptively for each component, based on an a posteriori error estimate of the global error. The multi-adaptive methods require the solution of large systems of nonlinear algebraic equations which are solved using explicit-type iterative solvers (fixed point iteration). If the system is stiff, these iterations may fail to converge, corresponding to the well-known fact that standard explicit methods are inefficient for stiff systems. To resolve this problem, we present an adaptive strategy for explicit time integration of stiff ODEs, in which the explicit method is adaptively stabilised by a small number of small, stabilising time steps.},

It has been found that the effects of spatial and temporal discretization when considered separately as commonly done, are far from adequate for most transient analysis. A better criterion manipulating the interdependent relationship between mesh size and time-step magnitude is imperative to achieve sufficiently accurate results of analysis. In this paper, the accuracy of the Newmark method is investigated by considering the two basic sources of errors, namely, numerical amplitude dissipation and velocity dispersion. The effects of both spatial and temporal discretizations are considered. A new technique to describe the characteristics of various frequency spectra is established. A criterion for mesh design and the selection of time-step magnitude is also proposed based on the combined effects of the amplitude dissipation and velocity dispersion. The efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed criterion are demonstrated using two one-dimensional wave propagation problems. A two-dimensional application shows that this criterion is equally applicable to multidimensional problems.},

It is derived from the difference of the solutions between an ordinary integration method (the Newmark scheme) and another higher-order one which assumes that the derivatives of accelerations vary linearly within each time step. It may be obtained directly without resolving new equations, so the additional computational cost is small and the implementation is convenient. Furthermore, it is shown that this error estimator may also be obtained by Taylor expansion or by a post-processing technique. Accordingly, an adaptive time-stepping procedure, which automatically adjusts the time-step size so that the local error at each time step is within a prescribed accuracy, is described. Numerical examples, including two single-DOF problems, a two-DOF problem and a multi-DOF model, are presented. The results show that the presented local error estimator is simple, reliable and accurate.},

  doi = {10/frn5ct},
  abstract = {This paper presents a new numerical algorithm for 2D nonisothermal time-stepping simulations of a nonlinear viscoelastic cast film process. A significant contribution of the algorithm is that an updated Lagrangian description of motion is employed, as opposed to the more conventional Eulerian description generally used for continuous polymer processing simulations. Furthermore, use is made of a Perzynatype constitutive equation, which is different from what is usually employed for molten polymers. The constitutive equation accommodates viscoelasticity, extensional thinning/thickening, and strain-hardening. This new numerical algorithm can find the steady-state film properties, and it can predict the onset of instability by observing draw resonance. The critical draw ratio is determined from the response problem, which means that the mathematical complications of the more common linear stability analysis are avoided. In terms of the stability of the film, it was observed that stability is decreased by extensional thinning, strain-hardening, and higher relaxation times, and stability is increased by higher heat transfer coefficients and higher ratios of air-gap length to die width.},

  abstract = {A new class of time-stepping algorithms for strongly coupled thermomechanical problems is presented which retains the computational convenience of traditional staggered algorithms without upsetting the unconditional stability property characteristic of fully implicit (monolithic) schemes.This class of methods was first introduced by the authors (in the general context of thermoplasticity) in the USCM held at Chicago, July 1991, and in the IUTAM symposium held at Hannover, Germany, September 1991 The proposed schemes are fractional step methods associated with a two phase operator split of the full non-linear system of thermoelasticity into an adiabatic elastodynamics phase, followed by a heat conduction phase at fixed configuration. This operator split is shown to inherit the contractivity property of the full problem of evolution, thus leading to unconditionally B-stable product formula algorithms. In sharp contrast with this stability result, traditional staggered algorithms based on an isothermal mechanical phase followed by a heat conduction phase with an effective heat source are shown to lead, at best, to conditionally stable schemes. It is further shown that the actual implementation of these two classes of schemes is essentially identical. The numerical simulations presented include both dynamic and quasi-static problems and are shown to closely replicate the stability estimates and non-linear stability results derived for these two classes of staggered schemes.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES It has been proposed that declining activities of the somatotrophic or gonadotrophic axes, or sedentary life style, are partial causes for geriatric losses of bone mineral density (BMD) and of lean body mass (LBM). The present study tested these hypotheses by determining, in both free-living and institutionalized elderly men, the correlations of bone mineral density (BMD), total body bone mineral content (TBBMC) and lean body mass (LBM) with the following predictor variables: age, body mass index, body weight, serum insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), serum testosterone, habitual physical activity and mobility.SUBJECTS Forty-nine independent, community-dwelling older men, and 49 men of similar age residing in two Veterans Administration extended care facilities. The age range was 58\textendash{}95 years.MEASUREMENTS Serum IGF-I and testosterone were measured by radioimmunoassay. Habitual physical activity in the independent men and mobility in the institutionalized men were estimated by standard instruments. LBM and bone status at nine skeletal sites were determined by dual X-ray absorptiometry.RESULTS The BMD and TBBMC values of the free living men were 4\textendash{}20\% higher than those of the institutionalized men. In the independent old men, serum testosterone was the strongest predictor of BMD and TBBMC, while age was the only predictor of LBM. In the chronically institutionalized men, age, body weight and immobility were the strongest predictors of body composition, and testosterone was correlated only with femoral neck BMD.CONCLUSIONS In aging independent men, low levels of testosterone are associated with demineralization of the skeleton. Immobility and under-weight are associated with the osteopenia of old men residing in nursing homes. In this cross-sectional study of elderly men, there was no evidence of a relation of the somatotrophic axis to bone status or LBM, or of the gonadotrophic axis to LBM.},

  doi = {10/b4jdfq},
  abstract = {The finite element method has been well established for numerically solving parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs). Also it is well known that a too large time step should not be chosen in order to obtain a stable and accurate numerical solution. In this article, accuracy analysis shows that a too small time step should not be chosen either for some time-stepping schemes. Otherwise, the accuracy of the numerical solution cannot be improved or can even be worsened in some cases. Furthermore, the so-called minimum time step criteria are established for the Crank-Nicolson scheme, the Galerkin-time scheme, and the backward-difference scheme used in the temporal discretization. For the forward-difference scheme, no minimum time step exists as far as the accuracy is concerned. In the accuracy analysis, no specific initial and boundary conditions are invoked so that such established criteria can be applied to the parabolic PDEs subject to any initial and boundary conditions. These minimum time step criteria are verified in a series of numerical experiments for a one-dimensional transient field problem with a known analytical solution. The minimum time step criteria developed in this study are useful for choosing appropriate time steps in numerical simulations of practical engineering problems. \textcopyright{} 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In a series of steps, these coefficients are selected to (i) maximize algebraic accuracy by matching terms of Taylor's expansions of exact and approximate solutions, (ii) ensure unconditional stability and (iii) optimize numerical conditioning of the equations in a limiting case. Equations required to implement the procedure are presented. The method as presented has no algorithmic damping of higher modes, although it is indicated how this may be achieved.

  abstract = {Rock socketed piles have a number of features which differentiate them from other types of piles. The generally stubby geometry leads to more even distribution of capacity between shaft and base. However, the low ratio of pile modulus to rock modulus leads to high compressibility and this, coupled with a tendency for the load transfer response along the shaft to exhibit strain-softening, gives rise to an overall response where the shaft capacity may be fully mobilized, and potentially degraded, before significant mobilization of base load.The paper presents results of finite element analyses of the response of rock-socketed piles, with particular attention to the shaft response with and without intimate base contact. The shaft interface uses a model, developed from principles of tribology, that includes dilation (and strain-hardening) prior to peak shaft friction, followed by strain-softening at larger displacements. The results of the study are shown to be consistent with field measurements, and to capture effects of the absolute pile diameter on the peak shaft friction. It is also shown that intimate base contact mitigates significantly the degree of strain-softening of the shaft response.},

  abstract = {A three-dimensional hydrodynamic and sediment transport model was used to study the relative impact of (1) vegetation, (2) micro-topography, and (3) water level fluctuations on the spatial flow and sedimentation patterns in a tidal marsh landscape during single inundation events. The model incorporates three-dimensional (3-D) effects of vegetation on the flow (drag and turbulence). After extensive calibration and validation against field data, the model showed that the 3-D vegetation structure is determinant for the flow and sedimentation patterns. As long as the water level is below the top of the vegetation, differences in flow resistance between vegetated and unvegetated areas result in faster flow routing over unvegetated areas, so that vegetated areas are flooded from unvegetated areas, with flow directions more or less perpendicular to the vegetation edge. At the vegetation edge, flow velocities are reduced and sediments are rapidly trapped. In contrast, in between vegetated areas, flow velocities are enhanced, resulting in reduced sedimentation or erosion. As the water level overtops the vegetation, the flow paths described above change to more large-scale sheet flow crossing both vegetated and unvegetated areas. As a result, sedimentation patterns are then spatially more homogeneous. Our results suggest that the presence of a vegetation cover is the key factor controlling the long-term geomorphic development of tidal marsh landforms, leading to the formation of (1) unvegetated tidal channels and (2) vegetated platforms with a levee-basin topography in between these channels.},

  abstract = {The influence of non-linear thermal parameters on moisture distribution predictions in an unsaturated soil is investigated. A fully non-linear numerical model of coupled heat and mass transfer is used to analyse the one dimensional drying of a stratum of loam. The distribution of moisture content in the upper 0.5 m of soil is the subject of interest. Assumed representative material parameters are used.The results show small but significant changes in moisture content variations when either the value of the thermal conductivity or the heat capacity alone is kept constant. When both are held constant, however, a cancellation of effects occurs. This is attributed to the fact that the thermal gradients in the soil remain largely unchanged when compared with fully non-linear values. Actual magnitudes of temperatures are different but the thermal gradients are not.These conclusions cannot be generalized at this stage beyond the problem dependent results achieved. The results are, however, viewed as a contribution to a greater overall understanding of the complex problem under consideration.},

The forcing fields are the Florida State University observed winds, winds derived from the NASA Scatterometer (NSCAT), and stresses derived directly from NSCAT. The sea level data sets are the World Ocean Circulation Experiment ``fast'' sea level data set from island measurements and sea level anomalies from TOPEX/POSEIDON. Results of this comparison demonstrate that while the three model results are qualitatively similar, the results are quantitatively better when forcing with the NSCAT derived stresses. This is particularly true in the eastern tropical Pacific and in convergent zones where forcing with the NSCAT stresses can lead to large differences in ULT ($>$40 m) compared with results from the other two wind products.},

Soil nitrate content and EC increased significantly to 120 cm depth with increasing rates of applied N. An opposite trend was found for soil pH within the upper 20 cm. Cumulative N2O emission and maximum N2O emission rates both increased significantly with increasing N rates. Tomato yield increased significantly from the N0 to N1 rate, but remained constant from the N1 to N2 one. Nitrate concentration in tomatoes also increased significantly with N rates. A contrasting trend was found for soluble sugar and organic acid concentrations. The results indicate that the commonly used N2 rate is excessive and causes adverse effects on tomato quality and on the environment.

This paper proves that the only unconditionally stable, second-order accurate, 3-step LMS method possessing asymptotic annihilation is Houbolt's method, which is known to be overly dissipative in the low-frequency regime. Thus, using LMS methods, obtaining asymptotic annihilation with little low-frequency dissipation requires at least a 4-step method.},

Two of the three schemes obtained using a quadratic interpolation equation and quadratic weighting functions are also shown to be unconditionally unstable. The third scheme is unconditionally stable, but the calculated values for a numerical solution of u\. + u = 0, u(0) = 1 are not as accurate as the values obtained using the single-step central difference method.},

  abstract = {The NCAR regional climate model RegCM is coupled to the WAM ocean model, using the sea-state-dependent roughness parameterization derived in the HEXOS experiment. Coupled model simulations are shown to give reduced wind speeds U10 compared to uncoupled simulations. This is in accord with other recent studies. However, the wave-atmosphere coupling is effected through the friction velocity field u*, rather than through the wind field U10. Thus because the coupling gives enhanced resistive friction, U10 is weakened, whereas u* is enhanced. Wave heights, driven by u*, are also increased in our coupled model simulations compared to uncoupled model simulations. Coupled model outputs are shown to compare favorably with air-sea observations collected during the recent Labrador Sea Deep Convection Experiment in 1997, both for synoptic storm timescales and for seasonal timescales.},

  abstract = {Fishers (Pekania pennanti) in the west coast states of Washington, Oregon, and California, USA have not recovered from population declines and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed options for listing them as threatened. Our objectives were to evaluate differences in survival and mortality risk from natural (e.g., predation, disease, injuries, starvation) and human-linked causes (e.g., rodenticide exposure [toxicants], vehicle strikes). We monitored survival of 232 radio-collared fishers at a northern and southern study site in the Sierra National Forest, California. We retrieved fisher carcasses, and used necropsy examinations to determine causes of death. We estimated survival and mortality rates using the Kaplan\textendash{}Meier estimator and nonparametric cumulative incidence functions, respectively, and integrated risk-specific survival rates into a Leslie matrix to evaluate how population growth ($\lambda$) might improve if management can reduce mortality from any of the risks. We determined cause of death for 93 of 121 fishers, and annual survival was 0.69 for all fishers, and 0.72 for female fishers. Mortality rates were 19.5\% for predation; 2.5\% for disease, injury, and starvation; and 1.9\% for toxicant exposure and vehicle strikes. Predation rates were similar between sexes, and relative risk was 51\% lower in fall and winter compared to spring and summer. Combined mortality from disease, injuries, starvation, vehicle strikes, and toxicants was 4.4\%, and 11 times higher for males than females. We estimated a base $\lambda$ at the northern site of 0.96, which had the potential to increase to 1.03 or 1.11 if predation were reduced by 25\% or 50\%, respectively, whereas $\lambda$ could increase to 0.97 in the absence of deaths from all other risks except predation. Predation was the dominant limiting factor in our study population, and was also the most common mortality risk for fishers in the 3 West Coast states (67\%), followed by disease, injury, and starvation (12\%) and vehicle strikes (8\%). Direct mortality from toxicants appeared limited to fishers in California. Our results identified the need for continued and potential expanded restrictions on habitat disturbance in fisher denning habitats. Research is needed on contact rates between larger predators and fishers, including whether fishers are more vulnerable to attack in open forests or along roads used by coursing predators. \textcopyright{} 2015 The Wildlife Society.},

It is based on the fact that the hodograph of such a dam consists simply of a triangle, plus an internal circular arc cut that represents the water table.

Both one- and two-dimensional fast Fourier transforms were generated from near and offshore regions of synthetic aperture radar data. The synthetic aperture radar-derived near and offshore spectral estimates exhibited both low- and high-frequency wave components. Classical bathymetrically controlled wave refraction was observed for both the short as well as long wave components of the sea surface. This paper demonstrates the ability of X band synthetic aperture radar to detect low-amplitude, long-period signals.

  abstract = {In this study we investigate the long term evolutionary trend of tidal marshes and their possible tendency to approach equilibrium. We account of the dynamic interaction between the marsh and its adjacent environment, allowing for both variations of marsh elevation and displacement of the marsh boundary. We thus consider a 1-D configuration consisting of a tidal channel merging into a 1-D marsh. Starting from some initial configuration of the channel we model how a salt marsh forms at the landward end of the channel and determine the long term evolution of the channel - marsh configuration under different scenarios of relative sea level rise. Previously established results on the morphodynamic evolution of a tidal channel are extended accounting for the effects of vegetation and wind driven sediment resuspension in regions where tidal stresses are too weak to mobilize sediments. Results suggest that, for sufficiently low rates of relative sea level rise the marsh platform may be able to reach an equilibrium elevation, provided wind resuspension is able to maintain a sufficiently large sediment concentration close to the marsh boundary. This is in general agreement with recent results based on zero dimensional modeling. However, we find that the marsh boundary is unstable, as progradation or retreat is generally experienced depending on a delicate balance between tidal transport and transport driven by wind setup. In this sense, actual morphodynamic equilibrium is a rather exceptional and unstable state.},

Structural modeling fit indices revealed that much of the variation and covariation in physical activity was explained by the model.

In the present study we investigated prospectively the effect of a moderate physical conditioning programme on plasma lipids and lipoproteins, especially HDL-cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I), the major apoprotein of HDL. Healthy, sedentary, middle-aged men were randomly selected and assigned either to a training group (n= 24, age 40$\pm$3\textendash{}4, mean $\pm$ SD) or to a control group (n= 13, age 39$\pm$50). Training consisted of various indoor and outdoor sports activities 45 min/day, 3 times/week for 12 weeks at an intensity of approximately 80\% of measured maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max). The trained subjects were studied at 4, 8 and 12 weeks. The training increased VO2 max by 12\% (P $<$ 0\textendash{}01). Increases were observed in both apo A-I (10\%, P $<$ 0 02) and HDL-cholesterol (8\%, P $<$ 002) after training, with significant increases already after 4 and 8 weeks, respectively. Furthermore, decreases in total plasma cholesterol (5\%, P $<$ 0004) and plasma triglycerides (26\%, P $<$ 0 003) were found without changes in body weight, body composition, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption or the percentage composition of dietary intake. Fasting serum-insulin concentrations decreased significantly during training. No changes were noted in the control group. The present study demonstrates prospectively that moderate physical training can increase HDL.},

  abstract = {Six patients with cutaneous melanoma were treated with intratumoral Bacillus Calmette-Gu{\'e}rin (BCG). Four showed good responses with regression of injected and, frequently, of uninjected lesions, whereas two developed dissemination and died. Three of four responders remain in complete remission. Two stra{\`\i}ns of BCG were used; there was no detectable difference in therapeutic efficacy. Three of four responders showed a significant increase in lymphocyte stimulation (LS) to melanoma antigens, and all responders showed a marked increase in phytohemagglutinin (PHA). Non-responders showed no increase to either stimulant. All responders were negative for leukocyte migration inhibition (LMI) to melanoma antigens before BCG, but two of four responders converted to positive after BCG therapy. Of the non-responders, one was positive and one was negative before therapy; there was no change following BCG. There was a marked increase in active rosette-forming cells (RFCS) in all responders and in only one of two non-responders. Preliminary studies suggest that BCG also affects the level of circulating inhibitors which abrogate the activity of immune lymphocytes to melanoma antigens. A definite sequence occurs following intratumoral BCG: (1) disruption of melanogenesis with release of pigment from tumor cells (3-6 h); (2) inflammatory response of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNS) and mononuclear cells which remain at the tumor periphery (6-24h); (3) tumor-cell death (24h); and (4) granulomas replacing tumor (2 weeks). The response to BCG resembles the immunologic and histopathologic changes observed in halo nevi. These studies suggest that BCG activates both tumor-specific and non-specific immune responses. Thus, in vitro parameters of cell-mediated immunity (CMI) are affected by BCG and some, particularly LS, LMI and the active rosette test, seem to correlate with clinical response.},

LDL-cholesterol (LDLC) in the post-menopausal women (Post-T: 96 $\pm$32 mg dl-1; Post-UT: 104 $\pm$23 mg dl-1) tended to be higher than in the premenopausal women (Pre-T: 86 $\pm$ 25 mg dl-1, Pre-UT: 81 $\pm$ 23 mg dl-1). LDLC/HDLC ratio in Post-UT (1$\cdot$42 $\pm$0$\cdot$38 unit) was higher than in the pre-menopausal women (Pre-T: 1$\cdot$03$\pm$0$\cdot$31 unit, P$<$0$\cdot$01; Pre-UT: 1$\cdot$10$\pm$0$\cdot$38 unit, P$<$0$\cdot$05), whereas the ratio in Post-T (1$\cdot$20 $\pm$0$\cdot$38 unit) was not different from those of the pre-menopausal groups.

The published literature contains no quantification of the threshold of lower limits of beneficial exercise or estimates of benefits derived from lower exercise levels. The specific aim of this study was to compare the effects of two walking frequencies, holding intensity and duration constant, on blood lipids, body composition, and exercise maintenance regimens of Mexican American women. A quasi-experimental design, with two treatment groups and one comparison group, was used to explore the dose-response effects of low-intensity exercise on cardiovascular outcomes. Significant interactions were found between walking and total serum cholesterol and skin-fold sums. This study demonstrated the clinical efficacy of a low-intensity exercise regimen on cardiovascular risk factors and exercise adherence. \textcopyright{} 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

  title = {Finite Element Modeling of Linear Elastodynamics Problems with Explicit Time-Integration Methods and Linear Elements with Reduced Dispersion. Comparative Study of Different Finite Element Techniques Used for Elastodynamics},
  abstract = {We have developed two finite element techniques with reduced dispersion for linear elastodynamics that are used with explicit time-integration methods. These techniques are based on the modified integration rule for the mass and stiffness matrices and on the averaged mass matrix approaches that lead to the numerical dispersion reduction for linear finite elements. The analytical study of numerical dispersion for the new techniques is carried out in the 1-D, 2-D and 3-D cases. The numerical study of the effectiveness of the dispersion reduction techniques includes two-stage time-integration approach with the filtering stage (developed in our previous papers) that quantifies and removes spurious high-frequency oscillations from numerical results. We have found that in contrast to the standard linear elements with explicit time-integration methods and the lumped mass matrix, the finite element techniques with reduced dispersion yield more accurate results at small time increments (smaller than the stability limit) in the 2D and 3-D cases. The advantages of the new technique are illustrated by the solution of the 1-D and 2-D impact problems. The new approaches with reduced dispersion can be easily implemented into existing finite element codes and lead to significant reduction in computation time at the same accuracy compared with the standard finite element formulations. Finally, we compare the accuracy of the linear elements with reduced dispersion, the spectral low- and high-order elements as well as the isogeometric elements by the solution of the 1-D impact problem. For all these solutions we use two-stage time integration technique with the filtering stage that removes spurious oscillations and allows an accurate comparison of different space discretization techniques used for elastodynamics. It is also interesting to mention that the amount of numerical dissipation at the filtering stage can be used as a quantitative measure for the comparison of accuracy of the different numerical formulations used for elastodynamics.},

  abstract = {When solving the equations of structural dynamics using direct time integration methods, algorithmic damping is useful in controlling spurious high-frequency oscillations. Ideally, an algorithm should possess asymptotic annihilation of the high-frequency response, i.e., spurious oscillations in the high frequencies are eliminated after one time step. In this paper, a new class of asymptotic annihilation algorithms for structural dynamics is presented that possesses little numerical dissipation in the low-frequency regime. The algorithms are based upon using finite elements in time. The displacement and velocity fields are interpolated independently using time-discontinuous functions. The equations of motion, displacement-velocity compatibility and the time continuity of displacement and velocity are satisfied weakly. Asymptotic annihilation is achieved by choosing the displacement and velocity fields to be of equal order. Algorithms of any desired order of temporal accuracy can be obtained by appropriate choice of the finite element interpolations in time. An analysis of the proposed class of algorithms is given proving the asymptotic annihilation property and the spectral equivalence of the algorithms to the upper diagonal of the Pad{\'e} approximation table. Results from finite difference analyses are presented showing the spectral behavior of the algorithms as well as their dissipation and dispersion properties in the low frequency regime.},

In this paper these time integration schemes are applied to simple non-linear dynamic systems and the performances of these schemes are compared. It is found that there are significant differences in the accuracy of these schemes. The result of some of these schemes are so inaccurate that it becomes clear that they are not suited for time integration over a long time duration. The behaviour of these schemes is also compared with that of the fourth order Runge\textendash{}Kutta method, which has been the preferred integration scheme for non-linear systems of a single or a few degrees of freedom.},

  abstract = {The performance of a family of nonlinear generalized single step-single solve (GSSSS) time integration schemes is assessed by comparison of their results in terms of total energy and the agreement with respective results published in the literature. The nonlinear algorithms have been developed by their linear counterparts using a Newton\textendash{}Raphson iterative procedure to ensure dynamic equilibrium inside each time step. A literature review of the available time integration schemes used for nonlinear problems and the family of linear GSSSS algorithms are presented along with several commonly used time integration algorithms as special cases. Afterwards, the nonlinear schemes are formulated, and outlined in an explicit flowchart, which describes the nonlinear integration procedure in detail. The nonlinear family of algorithms is applied to six benchmark problems involving the dynamic response of SDOF systems with various stiffness and damping properties, as well as to a 3dof structure representing finite element systems containing rigid connections, penalty factors and other such types of constraints. It is shown that the schemes with Continuous Acceleration formulation (such as the HHT-a method) perform in general better than the others, even with a large time step, which leads to reduced computational effort for the estimation of the nonlinear dynamic response with relatively little loss of accuracy.},

For an algorithm to be accurate, it has been suggested that the spurious root must be small and ideally be zero in the low-frequency limit. In the paper we show that good accuracy can be achieved even if the spurious root does not tend towards zero in the low-frequency limit. This permits more flexibility in the design of time integration algorithms. As an example, we present an algorithm that has greater accuracy than several other dissipative algorithms even though for all frequencies its spurious root is non-zero. We also show that the degraded performance of the Bazzi-$\rho$ algorithm is not due to its non-zero spurious root.},

The conversion of the Houbolt method to a one-step method is reported in the literature. However, the resulting method still lacks an appropriate starting procedure for all practical cases. In this paper, a parameter-less unified starting procedure is proposed for time integration with the Houbolt method. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Differential equations and boundary conditions are obtained from the elastic potential energy functional without assuming coincidence of the beam axis with any of the structural axes. This procedure gives a unique consistent definition of sectional moments and generalized forces. Some simple explicit formulae are derived for homogeneous tension\textendash{}torsion. For the general case a computer code is developed on the basis of discretized generalized displacements and a modified energy functional, devised to obtain consistent lengthwise variation of the stresses and a unique decomposition of the torsional moment. Examples show agreement with analytical results for cylindrical beams and illustrate the various coupling effects for beams with pretwist. They also demonstrate the usefulness of the explicit formulae for homogeneous tension\textendash{}torsion.},

The necessary numerical techniques are analysed from the point of view of accuracy, performance and storage requirements when implemented in scalar and vector processors with large storage capacity. The method is implemented on an IBM 3090 with vector facility.For this implementation we consider five different time integration schemes (explicit and implicit central difference, Houbolt, constant average acceleration and Wilson), and in the implicit case, both direct (Gaussian decomposition) and iterative (successive over-relaxation, Jacobi semi-iterative, Jacobi conjugate gradient) sparse linear systems solvers. These solvers are taken from the ITPACK2C and ESSL libraries using in each case the adequate representation scheme; skyline, row-wise and compressed diagonal.From our results it is concluded that constant average acceleration and explicit central difference are the most adequate integration methods and Jacobi conjugate gradient is the most efficient solver.},

The resultant optimum four-level-time schemes produced very accurate results, satisfied physical reality, and did not produce any oscillations for the specific problems that were studied. The optimum values for the three parameters $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ in the four-level-time scheme were $\alpha$ = 16.72, $\beta$ = 6.26 and $\gamma$ = 2.46. The optimum value of \texttheta{} for the Wilson-\texttheta{} method was \texttheta{} = 1.42. The optimum schemes were compared to some existing four-level-time schemes.

The design input in this procedure is defined in terms of relative acceleration and relative velocity spectra. The relative spectra can be related to pseudo spectra.

Closed-form torsional frequencies and mode shapes are derived from the linear terms of the resulting non-linear equations. As the length-to-leg ratio (L/b) and leg-to-thickness ratio (b/t) of typical open-profile bars are varied, the individual and collective effects of warping and pretwist on the non-dimensional torsional frequencies are demarcated. In addition, the closed-form solutions offered here reveal considerable destiffening of the torsional frequencies due to warping-pretwist coupling present in thin-walled bars having pretwisted, unsymmetrical, open-profiles and torsionally clamped and pinned end restraints. This coupling effect, which have been ignored in thin-walled bar vibration theories hitherto, is brought out by the Wagner effect and warping shear stresses acting on the profiles.},

Further, we show that the mid-point rule formulated in the spatial representation is, in general, physically and geometrically meaningless. An alternative algorithm is developed which exactly preserves energy, and the total spatial angular momentum in incremental force-free motions. The implicit version of this algorithm is unconditionally stable and second order accurate. The explicit version conserves exactly angular momentum in incremental force-free motions. Numerical simulations are presented which illustrate the excellent performance of the proposed procedure, even for incremental rotations over 65 degrees. The procedure is directly applicable to transient dynamic calculations of geometrically exact rods and shells.},

These NRCS data are first collocated with numerous National Data Busy Center buoys (within $\pm$0.5$^\circ$ latitude and longitude) and are then processed using the new Weissman et al. [1994] Frontal Air-Sea Interaction Experiment model to produce 25-km by 25-km spatial averages of the friction velocity for several contiguous areas within this region. One method of validation of these estimates involves comparisons with friction velocity estimates derived from data collected by the buoys using bulk methods. This was conducted at numerous locations; the Atlantic and Pacific coastlines and within the Gulf of Mexico. It is found that there is excellent agreement between these two different measurements. In addition, this approach enabled the derivation of estimates of the surface drag coefficient, with the use of the buoy winds, neutral stability winds at 10-m elevation, U10N, and the scatterometer surface friction velocity u*. This permitted the study of the dependence of this drag coefficient CD on wind speed in these different regions on spatial scales, which had not previously been possible. Comparisons are made to previously published models of CD that only depend on wind speed, with generally good agreement at winds over 6 m-1 s, but with significant regional differences at winds less than 6 m-1 s.},

The four coefficients of the cubic are chosen to satisfy the two initial conditions and two weighted integral equations. By considering general weight functions, eight additional coefficients arise. These coefficients are selected to (i) minimize the difference between exact and approximate solutions for small time steps, (ii) incorporate specified algorithmic damping for large time steps, (iii) ensure unconditional stability and (iv) minimize numerical operations in forming the amplification matrix.

  abstract = {A modification (Irons;6 Concus et al.1) to the conjugate gradient (CG) method by Hestenes and Stiefel5 has recently renewed the interest in this elegant technique which appears to be extraordinarily promising for large sparse systems Ax = b, where A is a symmetric positive definite matrix. A good approximation K-1 for the inverse of A is needed in the modified algorithm. For finite difference sets of equations, Meijerink and van der Vorst9 and Kershaw7 have experienced a very fast convergence with a matrix K-1 determined by the incomplete Cholesky decomposition of A.A further acceleration of the iteration may be achieved by preliminarily processing the initial guessed solution by the Newton iterative scheme before using the modified conjugate gradient (MCG) method. The initial Newton iterations (NI) have the useful property of significantly reducing the components of the residual r0 along the eigenvectors of AK-1 associated with the eigenvalues lying in the vicinity of 1. The latter are expected to include the vast majority of the eigenvalues of AK-1. As a result the MCG method is left with a smaller number of r0 components to set to zero in a reduced dimensional eigenvector space and hence the solution is arrived at in fewer iterations. Depending on the desired final accuracy, up to 50 per cent of the MCG iterations may be equivalently replaced by an equal number of NI which are computationally faster.This approach has been applied to the solution of finite element sets of linear equations arising from the arbitrarily irregular triangle discretization of groundwater flow domains in both steady and unsteady conditions. For diagonally dominant matrices the results emphasize the excellent performance of the MCG method which proved much faster than the first-degree Chebyshev iteration (CHI) and required a number of iterations an order of magnitude smaller than the successive over-relaxation technique (SOR) with optimum over-relaxation factor.},

The practical application of the model is demonstrated in simulations of a small subcatchment of the Konza Prairie reserve near Manhattan, Kansas. In a preliminary investigation of computational issues related to model resolution, we obtain satisfactory numerical results using large aspect ratios, suggesting that horizontal grid dimensions may not be unreasonably constrained by the typically much smaller vertical length scale of a catchment and by vertical discretization requirements. Additional tests are needed to examine the effects of numerical constraints and parameter heterogeneity in determining acceptable grid aspect ratios. In other simulations we attempt to match the observed streamflow response of the catchment, and we point out the small contribution of the streamflow component to the overall water balance of the catchment.},

A series of magnetostatics and eddy current problems are solved to demonstrate the validity and efficiency of the procedure. These numerical results indicate that the combined finite\textendash{}infinite element procedure is computationally much more economical for the solution of unbounded electromagnetic problems, especially when using the vector potential formulation, as the number of system equations decreases substantially compared to the finite element only procedure.

This adjustment works as long as there is a relationship between \{CI\} vs. \texttheta{} and Bd. A time-series analysis is used to eliminate the serial correlation of errors when separating treatments across depths. This is done by using a first- or second-order data transformation based on residuals and a general linear method of analysis, the parameter estimates obtained are unbiased and standard errors associated with these estimates are correct.},

Our approach is based on the interpolation of the solution by radial basis functions (RBFs) and is independent of the geometry of the domain. The existence and unicity of such of an interpolant will be established by the mean of linear algebra arguments. This spatial discretization transforms the initial problem into a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We give a simple formulation of implicit Runge-Kutta (IRK) schemes that can be used to numerically solve this system of ODEs. The main difficulty in the implementation of an IRK method lies in the fact that it leads to a potentially large linear or nonlinear system that has to be solved at each time step. A matrix-GMRES approach, coupled with a Newton based linearization technique in the nonlinear case, will be used to numerically solve these systems. Some numerical examples will be provided to illustrate the performance of our approach. \&copy; 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The multilevel algorithm studied employs a hierarchy of nested meshes with overlapping Schwarz preconditioners on each level and is additive within the levels and multiplicative among the levels. We perform several parallel tests on two Linux clusters, showing that the convergence of the method is independent of the number of subdomains (scalability), the discretization parameters and the number of levels (optimality). Moreover the comparison with the traditional Block Jacobi ILU parallel preconditioner and the V-cycle Multigrid parallel preconditioner shows that, on a whole heart cycle simulation, the proposed method attains the best performances in terms of CPU times. \&copy; 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We show how to transform a k-step formula-pair into a 2k-step single formula whose stability and order properties can be more easily studied. We present conditions that ensure that the formula-pair is stable at zero and infinity and we demonstrate that the stability properties of a formula-pair can differ substantially from those of its component formulas. The order analysis provides necessary and sufficient conditions on the coefficients of a formula-pair to obtain a local truncation error of order p + 2. These conditions are dependent upon the order properties of the component formulas. Consequently, given the order of the component formulas, the order of the formula-pair is easily determined.},

A portable translator program accepts statements of the system of differential equations and produces a portable FORTRAN object code which is then run to solve the system. At each step of the integration, the object program generates the series for each component of the solution, analyzes that series to determine the optimal step, and extends the solution by analytic continuation. The translator is easy to use, yet it is powerful and flexible. The computer time required by this approach consists of time to run the translator plus time to run the object code, CPU time and storage requirements depend on the size and complexity of the system of ODEs. Theoretical estimates and empirical test results are given for Hull's test problems, and comparisons with DVERK and DGEAR from IMSL are given. The computer time for all preproeessmg, compilation, and linking Is included Taylor series method executes faster and yields a more accurate answer than the standard methods for most of the problems in the test set. The Taylor series method is most attractwe for small systems and for stringent accuracy tolerances.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.engstruct.2016.09.024},
  abstract = {Simulating the nonlinear behavior of complex systems requires significant computational effort. Despite the rapid progress in computing technology, the demand is still strong for more efficient simulation methods in diverse structural dynamics fields such as nonlinear system identification and nonlinear system reliability. In addition to efficiency, algorithmic stability and accuracy must be addressed in the development of new simulation procedures. In this paper, a method to treat localized nonlinearities in a structure efficiently and accurately is proposed. The method is conditionally stable. The system equations are separated into a state-invariant linear part and a state-dependent nonlinear part that is considered to be external pseudo-forces that act on the linear system. The response of the system is obtained by fixed point iterations in which the pseudo-forces are updated until convergence. In addition to the one time-step-ahead prediction form, the novel idea of multiple time-step-ahead prediction is proposed. The effect of this approach is investigated and shown to increase algorithm efficiency and stability. To perform the numerical integration, time-stepping schemes like the exponential first-order hold method can be used to the advantage of efficiency and accuracy. To increase the accuracy and stability of the method, a novel second-order hold equivalent is derived and implemented. The efficiency, stability, and accuracy of the method are demonstrated in numerical examples. Finally, the method is applied to the earthquake-induced motion of a 20-story building with local nonlinearities. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {For many years the methods of choice for the numerical solution of stiff initial value problems and certain classes of differential algebraic equations have been the well-known backward differentiation formulae (BDF). More recently, however, new classes of formulae which can offer some important advantages over BDF have emerged. In particular, some recent large-scale independent comparisons have indicated that modified extended backward differentiation formulae (MEBDF) are particularly efficient for general stiff initial value problems and for linearly implicit DAEs with index 猢3. In the present paper we survey some of the more important theory associated with these formulae, discuss some of the practical applications where they are particularly effective, e.g., in the solution of damped highly oscillatory problems, and describe some significant recent extensions to the applicability of MEBDF codes.},

When two Gauss points in the integration interval are selected as collocation points, both an A-stable algorithm with third order accuracy and a non-dissipative algorithm with fourth order accuracy can be derived from a second order collocation polynomial. The only difference is that the former obtains a numerical solution at the middle point of the time interval, while the latter has a solution at the end of the interval. A new composite method is established through applying these two algorithms alternately, which combines the advantages of the numerical dissipation property of the third order algorithm and the high-order accuracy of the fourth order algorithm. The usage frequency of the two algorithms during the whole step-by-step integration procedure is an important parameter affecting the numerical dissipation, which is investigated in this study. As the algebraic equations systems solved by the two algorithms are exactly same, no extra computation effort is introduced.},

  title = {Hierarchical Higher-Order Dissipative Methods for Transient Analysis},
  volume = {67},
  abstract = {This work focuses on devising an efficient hierarchy of higher-order methods for linear transient analysis, equipped with an effective dissipative action on the spurious high modes of the response. The proposed strategy stems from the N酶rsett idea and is based on a multi-stage algorithm, designed to hierarchically improve accuracy while retaining the desired dissipative behaviour. Computational efficiency is pursued by requiring that each stage should involve just one set of implicit equations of the size of the problem to be solved (as standard time integration methods) and, in addition, all the stages should share the same coefficient matrix. This target is achieved by rationally formulating the methods based on the discontinuous collocation approach. The resultant procedure is shown to be well suited for adaptive solution strategies. In particular, it embeds two natural tools to effectively control the error propagation. One estimates the local error through the next-stage solution, which is one-order more accurate, the other through the solution discontinuity at the beginning of the current time step, which is permitted by the present formulation. The performance of the procedure and the quality of the two error estimators are experimentally verified on different classes of problems. Some typical numerical tests in transient heat conduction and elasto-dynamics are presented. Copyright 漏 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

For explicit Runge-Kutta methods estimates of the local truncation error are normally used, and currently the most efficient estimates may be obtained as differences of certain pairs of methods of successive orders. Because of the difficulty of deriving methods of intermediate orders of accuracy, and because such methods are efficient for many problems with moderate tolerance requirements, the methods derived by Fehlberg have become particularly well-known. Unfortunately, for problems that reduce to the evaluation of quadratures, Fehlberg's methods give error estimates which are identically zero, and hence the estimates are unreliable for problems that are at least partially of this type. The methods developed here are designed to overcome this difficulty. The approach yields new methods of arbitrarily high orders of accuracy, and the parameters of four particular pairs of methods of orders 5(6), 6(7), 7(8), 8(9) are included.},

The nonlinear parameter-varying differential equations for the perturbation motion are expressed in the form of Hamiltonian equations with time-varying Hamiltonian, and are converted further into the classical Hamiltonian equations with extended time-invariant Hamiltonian by augmenting the state variables. The solution to the augmented Hamiltonian equations has the symplectic structure in terms of the symplectic transformation. Then the difference equations of the symplectic Runge-Kutta algorithm with a sufficient condition are constructed, which is proved to preserve the intrinsic symplectic structure of the original solution. In particular, the symplectic Gauss-Runge-Kutta algorithm with stage 2 and order 4 is proposed and applied to the stability analysis of a nonlinear system. Unstable regions based on the nonlinear periodic-parameter perturbation equation are obtained by using the symplectic Gauss-Runge-Kutta algorithm, analytical solution method and non-symplectic conventional Runge-Kutta algorithm to verify the higher accuracy of the proposed algorithm. Unstable regions based on the nonlinear perturbation are given to illustrate the improvement over those based on the linear perturbation. The developed symplectic approach to the stability analysis can preserve the symplectic structure of the original system and is applicable to nonlinear parametric excited systems with multi-degree-of-freedom. \&copy; 2009 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

These alternative simulation procedures rely on an assumption of local Gaussianity during each time step. This assumption is tantamount to various linearizations of the equations of motion. All of the proposed procedures yield the exact results as the time step goes to zero. The proposed procedures are based on analytical convolutions of the excitation process, hereby, reducing the generation of stochastic processes and numerical integration to the generation of random vectors only. Such a treatment offers higher rates of convergence, faster speed and higher accuracy. These procedures are compared to the direct Monte Carlo simulation procedure, which uses a fourth order Runge-Kutta scheme with the white noise process approximated by a broad band Ruiz-Penzien broken line process. The comparisons show that the so-called Ermark-Allen algorithm developed for simulation applications in molecular dynamics is the most favourable procedure for MDOF structural systems.},

  issn = {00361445},
  abstract = {In the past numerical stability theory for initial value problems in ordinary differential equations has propagation mechanisms in stiff problems a question modeled effectively by contractive linear or nonlinear problems. While this has resulted in a coherent and self-contained body of knowledge, it has never been entirely clear to what extent this theory is relevant for problems exhibiting more complicating dynamics. This on-going work is unified and in particular, striking similarities between this new developing stability theory and the classical linear and nonlinear stability theories are emphasized. The classical theories of A, B and algebraic stability for Runge-Kutta methods are briefly reviewed: the dynamics of solutions within the classes of equations to which these theories apply-linear decay and contractive problems - are studied. Four other categories of equations-gradient, dissipative, conservative and Hamiltonian systems - are considered. Relationships and differences between the possible dynamics in each category, which range from multiple competing equilibria to chaotic solutions, are highlighted. Runge-Kutta schemes that preserves the dynamical structures of the underlying problem are sought and indications of a strong relationship between the developing stability theory for these new categories and the classical existing stability theory for the older problems are given. Algebraic stability in particular, is seen to play a central role. It should be emphasized that in all cases the class of methods for which a coherent and complete numerical stability theory exists given a structural assumption on the initial value problem, is often considerably smaller than the class of method found to be effective in practice. Nonetheless it is arguable that it is valuable to develop such stability theories to provide a firm theoretical framework in which to interpret existing methods and to formulate goals in the construction of new methods. Furthermore, there are indications that the theory of algebraic stability may sometimes be useful in the analysis of error control codes which are not stable in a fixed step implementation this work is described.},

  abstract = {The solution of initial value problems provide the state history for a given dynamic system, for prescribed initial conditions. Existing methods for solving these problems have not been very successful in exploiting parallel computation architectures, mainly because most of the integration methods implemented on parallel machines are only modified versions of forward integration approaches, which are typically poorly suited for parallel computation. This article proposes parallel-structured modified Chebyshev-Picard iteration (MCPI) methods, which iteratively refine estimates of the solutions until the iteration converges. Using Chebyshev polynomials as the orthogonal approximation basis, it is straightforward to distribute the computation of force functions and polynomial coefficients to different processors. A vector-matrix form is introduced that makes the methods computationally efficient. The power of the methods is illustrated through satellite motion propagation problems. Compared with a Runge-Kutta 4-5 forward integration method implemented in MATLAB, the proposed methods generate solutions with improved accuracy as well as several orders of magnitude speedup, even before parallel implementation. Allowing only to integrate position states or perturbation motion achieve further speedup. Parallel realization of the methods is implemented using a graphics processing unit to provide inexpensive parallel computation architecture. Significant further speedup is achieved from the parallel implementation.},

The half order technique is a powerful tool with which one can use an m 聽 -order Fourier expansion to interpolate as many as up to 4 m + 1 mathContainer Loading Mathjax points. In this paper, the best scales in the multi-scale Fourier expansion interpolation are derived based on the idea of equating the norm of each column of the interpolated matrix, such that the condition number of the preconditioned matrix is minimized.

  volume = {104},
  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a three-point coupled compact integrated radial basis function (CCIRBF) approximation scheme for the discretisation of second-order differential problems in one and two dimensions. The CCIRBF employs integrated radial basis functions (IRBFs) to construct the approximations for its first and second derivatives over a three-point stencil in each direction. Nodal values of the first and second derivatives (i.e. extra information), incorporated into approximations by means of the constants of integration, are simultaneously employed to compute the first and second derivatives. The essence of the CCIRBF scheme is to couple the extra information of the nodal first and second derivative values via their identity equations. Owing to its coupling of the information of the nodal first and second derivatives, the CCIRBF scheme becomes more accurate, stable and efficient than the normal compact integrated radial basis function (CIRBF) schemes proposed by [Thai-Quang, Mai-Duy, Tran, and Tran-Cong (2012)]. The main features of the CCIRBF scheme include: three-point, high-order accuracy, stability, efficiency and inclusion of boundary values. Several analytic problems are considered to verify the present scheme and to compare its accuracy, stability and efficiency with those of the CIRBF, higher-order compact finite difference (HOC) and some other high-order schemes. Numerical results show that highly accurate and stable results are obtained with the proposed scheme. Additionally, the present scheme also takes less time to achieve target accuracy in comparison with the CIRBF and HOC schemes.},

  volume = {49},
  abstract = {We present a theoretical investigation of the thermoelastic wave propagation in the phononic crystals in the context of Green鈥揘agdhi theory by taking thermoelastic coupling into account. The thermal field is assumed to be steady. Thermoelastic wave band structures of 3D and 2D are derived by using the plane wave expansion method. For the 2D problem, the anti-plane shear mode is not affected by the temperature difference. Thermoelastic wave bands of the in-planex鈥搚mode are calculated for lead/silicone rubber, aluminium/silicone rubber, and aurum/silicone rubber phononic crystals. The new findings in the numerical results indicate that the thermoelastic wave bands are composed of the pure elastic wave bands and the thermal wave bands, and that the thermal wave bands can serve as the low boundary of the first band gap when the filling ratio is low. In addition, for the lead/silicone rubber phononic crystals the effects of lattice type (square, rectangle, regular triangle, and hexagon) and inclusion shape (circle, oval, and square) on the normalized thermoelastic bandwidth and the upper/lower gap boundaries are analysed and discussed. It is concluded that their effects on the thermoelastic wave band structure are remarkable.},

Moreover, they are endowed with large stability limits and controllable numerical dissipation by means of an algorithmic parameter. Thereby, the resulting algorithms appear to be competitive with standard explicit algorithms for structural dynamics. Representative numerical simulations are presented illustrating the performance of the proposed numerical schemes and confirming the analytical results.},

  abstract = {The Wilson-\texttheta{} method has been proven to have unconditional stability as a numerical direct time integration method in structural dynamics when \texttheta{} $\geq$ 1.37 is adopted. Notwithstanding this great advantage of the method, it has also been proven that the method suffers from two shortcomings: high amount of uncontrollable amplitude decay and period elongation. In other words, the unconditional stability allows time step to be stretched, but as the time step grows longer, amplitude decay and period elongation errors grow higher, resulting in a low level of accuracy. The improved version of the Wilson-\texttheta{} method negates the disadvantages of the classic method by raising the order of acceleration to vary in quadratic scheme over time step domain and by introducing an accelerator coefficient to the acceleration formula in order to control the amount of amplitude decay and lessen the period elongation error. The stability and accuracy of the proposed method has been analyzed, and the results show that unconditional stability is obtained if \texttheta{} $\geq$ 1.38 is adopted. A formula is derived for the accelerator coefficient to make it applicable to various types of structural dynamic problems. Numerical examples are presented to provide a practical assessment of the method, along with the classic Wilson-\texttheta{} and other methods of similar class.},

  abstract = {We present efficient and stable numerical methods for approximations of the generalized Zakharov system (GZS) and vector Zakharov system for multicomponent plasma (VZSM) with/without a linear damping term. The key points in the methods are based on (i) a time-splitting discretization of a Schro\&die;dinger-type equation in GZS or VZSM, (ii) discretizing a nonlinear wave-type equation by a pseudospectral method for spatial derivatives, and (iii) solving the ordinary differential equations (ODEs) in phase space analytically under appropriate chosen transmission conditions between different time intervals or applying Crank-Nicolson/leap-frog for linear/nonlinear terms for time derivatives. The methods are explicit, unconditionally stable, and of spectral-order accuracy in space and second-order accuracy in time. Moreover, they are time reversible and time transverse invariant when there is no damping term in GZS or VZSM, conserve (or keep the same decay rate of) the wave energy as that in GZS or VZSM without a (or with a linear) damping term, and give exact results for the plane-wave solution. Extensive numerical tests are presented for plane waves and solitary-wave collisions in one-dimensional GZS, and we also give the dynamics of three-dimensional VZSM to demonstrate our new efficient and accurate numerical methods. Furthermore, the methods are applied to study the convergence and quadratic convergence rates of VZSM to GZS and of GZS to the nonlinear Schro\&die;dinger (NLS) equation in the "subsonic limit" regime (0 \&lt; \&Epsilon; \&lt; 1), where the parameter \&Epsilon; is inversely proportional to the acoustic speed. Our tests also suggest that the following meshing strategy (or \&Epsilon;-resolution) is admissible in this regime: spatial mesh size h = O(\&Epsilon;) and time step k = O(\&Epsilon;). \&copy; 2005 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.},

  copyright = {Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.},
  abstract = {Many ordinary differential equations that describe physical phenomena possess solutions that cannot be obtained in closed form. To obtain the solutions to these systems, the use of numerical schemes is unavoidable. Traditional numerical analysis concerns itself with obtaining error bounds within finite closed time intervals; however, the study of asymptotic or long term behaviour of solutions generated by numerical schemes has attracted a lot of interest in recent years. It is now well established that numerical schemes for nonlinear autonomous differential equations can admit asymptotic solutions which do not correspond to those of the ODE. This thesis studies linearized one-point collocation methods, contributing to this important investigation by considering bifurcation phenomena in autonomous ODEs and studying the dynamics of the methods for nonautonomous ODEs. Using the theory of normal forms, it is established that the common codimension-1 bifurcations that exist in continuous dynamical systems will occur in the methods at the same phase space location. However, the methods can exhibit period doubling bifurcations, which are necessarily spurious. They also introduce a singular set, which drastically affects the global dynamics of the methods. The technique of stroboscopic sampling of the numerical solution is used to study the dynamics of nonautonomous ODEs with periodic solutions, and conditions under which the methods have a unique periodic solution that is asymptotically stable, are stated explicitly. A link between these conditions and nonautonomous linear and nonlinear stability theory is established.

  abstract = {In structural dynamics, integration algorithms are often used to obtain the solution of temporally discretized equations of motion at selected time steps. Various time integration algorithms have been developed in the time domain using different methods. In order for an integration algorithm to be reliable it must be stable and accurate. A discrete transfer function is used to study the properties of integration algorithms. A pole mapping rule from control theory in conjunction with a discrete transfer function is used to develop new integration algorithms for obtaining solutions to structural dynamics problems. A new explicit integration algorithm, called the CR (Chen and Ricles) algorithm, is subsequently developed based on the proposed method. The properties of the algorithm are investigated and compared with other well established algorithms such as the Newmark family of integration algorithms. By assigning proper stable poles to the discrete transfer function the newly developed CR explicit algorithm is unconditionally stable and has the same accuracy as the Newmark method with constant acceleration. In addition, the CR algorithm is based on expressions for displacement and velocity that are both explicit in form, making it an appealing integration algorithm for solving structural dynamics problems.},

This extra condition considered as the integral overspecification over the spacial domain. For discretizing the problem, after homogenization of the boundary conditions, we apply the Legendre pseudospectral method in a matrix based manner. As a results a system of nonlinear differential algebraic equations is generated. Then by using suitable transformation, the problem will be converted to a homogeneous time varying system of linear ordinary differential equations. Also a pseudospectral method for efficient solving of the resulted system of ordinary differential equations is proposed. The solution of this system gives the approximation to values of u and p. The matrix based structure of the present method makes it easy to implement. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and the efficiency of the proposed computational procedure. Copyright \&copy; 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {Over the last decade several general-purpose numerical methods for ordinary differential equations (ODEs) have been developed which generate a continuous piecewise polynomial approximation that is defined for all values of the independent variable in the range of interest. For such methods it is possible to introduce measures of the quality of the approximate solution based on how well the piecewise polynomial satisfies the ODE. This leads naturally to the notion of `defect-control'. Numerical methods that adopt error estimation and stepsize selection strategies in order to control the magnitude of the associated defect can be very effective and such methods are now being widely used. In this paper we will review the advantages of this class of numerical methods and present examples of how they can be effectively applied. We will focus on numerical methods for initial value problems (IVPs) and boundary value problems (BVPs) where most of the developments have been introduced but we will also discuss the implications and related developments for other classes of ODEs such as delay differential equations (DDEs) and differential algebraic equations (DAEs).},

Such systems can be efficiently treated by a class of implicit-explicit (IMEX) diagonally implicit multistage integration methods (DIMSIMs), where the stiff part is integrated by implicit formula, and the non-stiff part is integrated by an explicit formula. We analyze stability of these methods when the implicit and explicit parts interact with each other. We look for methods with large absolute stability region, assuming that the implicit part of the method is A ( $\alpha$ ) -, A-, or L-stable. Finally, we furnish examples of \{IMEX\} \{DIMSIMs\} of order p = 5 and p = 6 and stage order q = p , with good stability properties. Numerical examples illustrate that the \{IMEX\} schemes constructed in this paper do not suffer from order reduction phenomenon for some range of stepsizes.},

Differences between conditions were detected with the general linear method (factorial model). Barefoot running is characterized by a significantly larger external loading rate than the shod condition. The flatter foot placement at touchdown is prepared in free flight, implying an actively induced adaptation strategy. In the barefoot condition, plantar pressure measurements reveal a flatter foot placement to correlate with lower peak heel pressures. Therefore, it is assumed that runners adopt this different touchdown geometry in barefoot running in an attempt to limit the local pressure underneath the heel. A significantly higher leg stiffness during the stance phase was found for the barefoot condition. The sagittal kinematic adaptations between conditions were found in the same way for all subjects and at the three running velocities. However, large individual variations were observed between the runners for the rearfoot kinematics.},

  abstract = {This thesis documents three investigations carried out in pursuance of a doctoral degree in applied mathematics at the University of Colorado (Boulder). The first investigation concerns the properties of rotating Rayleigh-Benard convection \textendash{} thermal convection in a rotating infinite plane layer between two constant-temperature boundaries. It is noted that in certain parameter regimes convective Taylor columns appear which dominate the dynamics, and a semi-analytical model of these is presented. Investigation of the columns and of various other properties of the flow is ongoing. The second investigation concerns the interactions between planetary-scale and mesoscale dynamics in the oceans. Using multiple-scale asymptotics the possible connections between planetary geostrophic and quasigeostrophic dynamics are investigated, and three different systems of coupled equations are derived. Possible use of these equations in conjunction with the method of superparameterization, and extension of the asymptotic methods to the interactions between mesoscale and submesoscale dynamics is ongoing. The third investigation concerns the linear stability properties of semi-implicit methods for the numerical integration of ordinary differential equations, focusing in particular on the linear stability of IMEX (Implicit-Explicit) methods and exponential integrators applied to systems of ordinary differential equations arising in the numerical solution of spatially discretized nonlinear partial differential equations containing both dispersive and dissipative linear terms. While these investigations may seem unrelated at first glance, some reflection shows that they are in fact closely linked. The investigation of rotating convection makes use of single-space, multiple-time-scale asymptotics to deal with dynamics strongly constrained by rotation. Although the context of thermal convection in an infinite layer seems somewhat removed from large-scale ocean dynamics, the asymptotic methods generalize directly to the second investigation which simply adds large spatial scales \textendash{} the transition from convectively unstable to convectively stable dynamics does not change the mathematical framework. The rotating Navier-Stokes equations in the Boussinesq approximation and the equations derived from them asymptotically in the investigation of rotating convection include dispersive and dissipative linear terms that are stiff, i.e. that hinder numerical solution by explicit methods. A variety of methods which purport to alleviate this difficulty have been derived, and have been tested on and applied largely to problems with purely dissipative linear terms. But it was heretofore unfortunately quite difficult to judge and compare how effectively these methods achieve their goal when the stiff linear term is both dissipative and dispersive. The third investigation therefore introduces a visual, analytical method for comparing the linear stability properties of the various methods (the linear stability properties being a proxy for their ability to alleviate stiffness) and supports the results of this analysis by comprehensive numerical experiments.

  abstract = {Integration algorithms are typically utilized in structural dynamics to obtain solution to the temporally discretized equations of motion. Stability is an important issue to be considered when selecting the proper integration algorithm for analysis of structures with a large number of degrees of freedom. Recent development of real-time structural testing brings more challenges to researchers selecting appropriate integration algorithms. An explicit algorithm is more favorable because of its computational efficiency but often constrained by its conditional stability. Moreover, numerical errors often lead to the spurious growth of high-frequency response in the dynamic analysis and the presence of inevitable experimental errors will aggravate this effect in real-time structural testing. It is therefore desirable for an explicit algorithm to not only have unconditional stability but also possess numerical damping to suppress any spurious participation of the high-frequency response while the lower modes can be integrated accurately. This paper presents the development of an unconditionally stable explicit integration algorithm with controllable numerical damping using discrete control theory.},

Such an analysis has been performed in this work, under assumptions of planar electrode, one-dimensional semi-infinite spatial domain, and all diffusion coefficients either distinct or identical. It is shown that in the distinct diffusion coefficient case the eigenvalues of the matrix of the system of ordinary differential equations (obtained from the Laplace transformation of the PDEs) can be separated in the Laplace plane, which facilitates the derivation of the IEs. However, the IEs are found to be easily obtainable only in the case of sufficiently simple networks of homogeneous reactions, for which the matrices of rate constants are appropriately sparse. Further work is needed to develop mathematical and numerical techniques enabling the application of the IE method to complex reaction networks. \&copy; 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Numerical characteristics of this explicit method for linear elastic systems are almost the same as those of the constant average acceleration method while for a nonlinear system it is more efficient in computing than for the constant average acceleration method. This explicit method integrates the most promising advantages possessed by the explicit and implicit methods. No limitation on the time step in satisfying the stability limit, which is the most important property for an implicit method, is theoretically proved for this explicit method. Furthermore, the avoidance of solving any implicit system or using any iterative procedure, which usually brings considerable simplification in practical applications for explicit methods, leads to the very low cost of one explicit step. Thus, the computational effort can be significantly reduced when compared to implicit methods in each time step. Consequently, this explicit method can be used to solve dynamic problems efficiently due to the unconditional stability and the very low cost of explicit steps. Rough guidelines with regards to the selection of a time step in achieving accurate solutions for the constant average acceleration method are also appropriate for the proposed explicit method.},

  abstract = {Many technological applications need of differential models either for their microscopic or macroscopic description and, frequently, they involve non-linear equations. There is a class of differential models that is the diffusive-reaction type models that have a very large number of applications in different chemical engineering problems. These include transport and reaction in catalytic processes, heat and mass transfer in more than one phase, and electrostatic potentials in many current electrokinetic processes, just to name a few. Solutions to these models are either by linear approximations of the non-linear source, by other approximations of such non-linearity, or by numerical methods that frequently are heavily dependent of the mesh size for a successful convergence. In this contribution, an analytical-logarithmic approach is introduced and applied to unbounded domains of a rectangular, cylindrical, and spherical geometry for the case of electrostatic potential around a particle or an electrode in a given solution. Due to the lack of general methods to derive analytical solutions for differential models with non-linear sources, this study has focused on developing an efficient and economical procedure to obtain a formal analytical solution for such models that is used in a simple predictor-corrector approach to predict the correct solution. The proposed method involves the use of a recursive function, fAO$<$/inf$>$, of the non-linear dependable variable that work as a corrector function. The procedure converts the non-linear ordinary differential equation in a simpler pseudo-linear ordinary differential equation whose analytical solution is later modified by means of the fAO$<$/inf$>$ correction function to obtain the correct solution.

  abstract = {In this paper, a new accurate predictor-corrector time integration method is proposed, which has an appropriate stability domain. The dispersion error of the suggested approach is considerably smaller than that of the central difference scheme. Moreover, the presented technique introduces effectively numerical damping, which can be used to remove the spurious highfrequency components from the numerical responses. The authors鈥 approach has second-order accuracy for structures with and without damping. It is worth mentioning that the scheme solves the nonlinear problems without using iterative processes. The new algorithm is tested by using several linear and nonlinear numerical examples, and the outcomes are compared against the results of the central difference and explicit second-order Runge-Kutta schemes. The findings confirm the high accuracy and good performance of the suggested technique.},

Theoretical analysis indicates that the composite algorithmis a single-solver algorithm with satisfactory accuracy, unconditional stability, and second-order convergence rate. Moreover, without any additional parameters, the composite algorithm maintains a symmetric effective stiffness matrix and the computational cost is the same as that of the trapezoidal rule. And more merits of the proposed algorithm are revealed through several representative finite element examples by comparing with analytical solutions or solutions provided by other numerical techniques. Results show that not only the linear stiff problem but also the nonlinear problems involving nonlinearities of geometry, contact, and material can be solved efficiently and successfully by this composite algorithm. Thus the prospect of its implementation in existing finite element codes can be foreseen.},

  abstract = {Parameter estimation for nonlinear differential equations is notoriously difficult because of poor or even no convergence of the nonlinear fit algorithm due to the lack of appropriate initial parameter values. This paper presents a method to gather such initial values by a simple estimation procedure. The method first determines the tangent slope and coordinates for a given solution of the ordinary differential equation (ODE) at randomly selected points in time. With these values the ODE is transformed into a system of equations, which is linear for linear appearance of the parameters in the ODE. For numerically generated data of the Lorenz attractor good estimates are obtained even at large noise levels. The method can be generalized to nonlinear parameter dependency. This case is illustrated using numerical data for a biological example. The typical problems of the method as well as their possible mitigation are discussed. Since a rigorous failure criterion of the method is missing, its results must be checked with a nonlinear fit algorithm. Therefore the method may serve as a preprocessing algorithm for nonlinear parameter fit algorithms. It can improve the convergence of the fit by providing initial parameter estimates close to optimal ones. \&copy; 2013 The Author. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Based on the post-processing technique, a posteriori local error estimates for displacements, velocities and, thus, also the total energy norm error estimate are obtained. If the Newmark solutions are corrected at each step, the post-processed solutions are of third-order accuracy in the global sense, i.e. one-order improvement for the original Newmark solutions is achieved. We also discuss a method for estimating the global time integration error. We find that, when the total energy norm is used, the sum of the local error estimates will give a reasonable estimate for the global error.

It is obtained by a successive linearization of the Crank-Nicolson scheme, that is unconditionally stable, but requires solving non-linear equation at each time step. We applied our linearized scheme for the time integration of the challenging Cahn-Hilliard equation, modeling the phase separation in fluids. At each time step the resulting variational equation is solved using higher-order isogeometric finite element method, with B-spline basis functions. The method was implemented in the PETIGA framework interfaced via the PETSc toolkit. The GMRES iterative solver was utilized for the solution of a resulting linear system at every time step. We also apply a simple adaptivity rule, which increases the time step size when the number of GMRES iterations is lower than 30. We compared our method with a non-linear, two stage predictor-multicorrector scheme, utilizing a sophisticated step length adaptivity. We controlled the stability of our simulations by monitoring the Ginzburg-Landau free energy functional. The proposed integration scheme outperforms the two-stage competitor in terms of the execution time, at the same time having a similar evolution of the free energy functional. \&copy; The Authors.

We therefore propose a non-restrictive, comparatively fast yet highly sensitive method based on Monte Carlo approximation principles where locally multivariate maps are computed by averaging across voxelwise condition-discriminative information obtained from repeated stochastic sampling of fixed-size search volumes. On simulated data containing discriminative regions of varying size and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), the Monte Carlo method reduced the required computer resources by as much as 75\% compared to the searchlight with no reduction in mapping performance. Notably, the Monte Carlo mapping approach not only outperformed the general linear method (GLM), but also produced higher discriminative voxel detection scores than the searchlight irrespective of classifier (linear or nonlinear support vector machine), discriminative region size or CNR. The improved performance was explained by the information-average procedure, and the Monte Carlo approach yielded mapping sensitivities of a few percent lower than an information-average exhaustive search. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the algorithm on whole-brain, multi-subject functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from a tactile study, revealing that the central representation of gentle touch is spatially distributed in somatosensory, insular and visual regions.},

  doi = {10/fsjgrd},
  abstract = {In this paper, unconditionally stable higher-order accurate time step integration algorithms suitable for linear first-order differential equations based on the weighted residual method are presented. Instead of specifying the weighting functions, the weighting parameters are used to control the algorithm characteristics. If the numerical solution is approximated by a polynomial of degree n, the approximation is at least nth-order accurate. By choosing the weighting parameters carefully, the order of accuracy can be improved. The generalized Pade approximations with polynomials of degree n as the numerator and denominator are considered. The weighting parameters are chosen to reproduce the generalized Pade approximations. Once the weighting parameters are known, any set of linearly independent basic functions can be used to construct the corresponding weighting functions. The stabilizing weighting factions for the weighted residual method are then found explicitly. The accuracy of the particular solution due to excitation is also considered.

  abstract = {Non-linear dynamic problems governed by ordinary (ODE) or partial differential equations (PDE) are herein approached by means of an alternative methodology. A generalized solution named WEM by the authors and previously developed for boundary value problems, is applied to linear and non-linear equations. A simple transformation after selecting an arbitrary interval of interest T allows using WEM in initial conditions problems and others with both initial and boundary conditions. When dealing with the time variable, the methodology may be seen as a time integration scheme. The application of WEM leads to arbitrary precision results. It is shown that it lacks neither numerical damping nor chaos which were found to be present with the application of some of the time integration schemes most commonly used in standard finite element codes (e.g., methods of central difference, Newmark, Wilson-\&theta;, and so on). Illustrations include the solution of two non-linear ODEs which govern the dynamics of a single-degree-of-freedom (s.d.o.f.) system of a mass and a spring with two different non-linear laws (cubic and hyperbolic tangent respectively). The third example is the application of WEM to the dynamic problem of a beam with non-linear springs at its ends and subjected to a dynamic load varying both in space and time, even with discontinuities, governed by a PDE. To handle systems of non-linear equations iterative algorithms are employed. The convergence of the iteration is achieved by taking n partitions of T. However, the values of T/n are, in general, several times larger than the usual \&Delta;t in other time integration techniques. The maximum error (measured as a percentage of the energy) is calculated for the first example and it is shown that WEM yields an acceptable level of errors even when rather large time steps are used.},

  abstract = {This dissertation is concerned with numerical solutions to steady state 2-dimensional nonlinear elliptical partial differential equations with Dirichlet boundary conditions in a rectangular region. Three numerical schemes discussed in this dissertation are the iterative method, Newton's method, and the shooting method. In general the shooting method is only applied in ordinary differential equations, not in partial differential equations. In order to apply the shooting method and the Newton's method in a nonlinear partial differential equation, the alternating direction procedure is applied. Details of how to apply these three schemes are discussed in this dissertation as well as the implementation and numerical experiments. Numerical results show that the alternating direction shooting method and the alternating direction Newton's method performed better than the commonly used linearized iterative method. Moreover, the greatest advantage of using the alternating direction procedure on the shooting method and Newton's method is that the computation is totally parallel. Therefore, if a parallel computing were to be used, it could achieve greater speedup. However the shooting method suffers stability problems as in ordinary differential equations. One possible way in which instability may be conquered is the consideration of multiple shooting methods which is not the objective of this dissertation.

  abstract = {Two new methods of numerical integration of Cauchy problems for nonlinear ODEs of the first- and second-order, which have blow-up solutions are described. In such problems, the position of the singular point is not known in advance. The first method is based on obtaining an equivalent system of equations by applying a differential transformation, where the first derivative (given in the original equation) is chosen as a new independent variable, t=yx$<$/inf$>$\textsuperscript{\&prime;}. The second method is based on introducing a new auxiliary non-local variable of the form \&xi;=\&int;x0$<$/inf$>$$<$/inf$>$\textsuperscript{x}g(x,y,yx$<$/inf$>$\textsuperscript{\&prime;})dx with the subsequent transformation to the Cauchy problem for the corresponding system of coupled ODEs. Both methods lead to problems whose solutions are represented in parametric form and do not have blowing-up singular points; therefore the standard fixed-step numerical methods can be applied. The efficiency of the proposed methods is illustrated with a number of test problems that admit exact solutions. It is shown that the methods, based on special exp-type transformations (which are particular cases of the general non-local transformation), are more efficient than the method based on the hodograph transformation, the method of the arc-length transformation, and the method based on the differential transformation. The method, based on introducing a non-local variable, can be generalized to the n\&nbsp;th-order ODEs and systems of coupled ODEs. \&copy; 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

As a result, a general, consistent index reduction from arbitrarily high values to one is obtained, allowing the use of any suitable ODE integration algorithm, without the need for a specialized DAE solver. The EPM solution is intrinsically endowed with greater accuracy and stability than conventional counterparts, thus balancing the higher complexity of the procedure.

  copyright = {Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.},
  abstract = {Differential equations of the form F (x', x, t) = 0 with Fx' singular arise naturally in many applications and are generally called differential algebraic equations (DAE). There has been an extensive amount of research on numerical solutions of DAEs in recent years. While the classical ODE methods such as backward differentiation and Runga-Kutta methods can be used to numerically solve DAEs, they require the problem to have lower index or special structure. One approach proposed for solving more general, higher index DAEs is called explicit integration (EI). The original DAE is differentiated a number of times based on certain parameters and the new system of equations is solved using nonlinear least squares methods. The result is a computed ODE whose solutions contain the solutions of the DAE. It is called the least squares completion (LSC). This ODE is then numerically integrated by a classical numerical method. The EI method is computationally efficient and can be applied to a wide class of DAEs. However, the dynamics of the additional solutions present in the completion can effect the numerical integration, sometimes causing the numerical solutions to move away from the solution manifold. In this thesis, we analyze the additional dynamics of LSCs for linear DAEs. Starting with linear constant coefficient systems, we first examine the structure of the additional dynamics created by the standard LSC and then introduce two methods to modify the completion process so that the LSC will have additional dynamics with desired stability characteristics. The rate of stabilized convergence can be determined a priori by substituting an appropriate value for a parameter. We then extend the results to linear time variable systems.

  title = {Temporal and Pseudo-Temporal Numerical Integration Methods},
  copyright = {Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.},
  abstract = {Numerical methods for integrating partial differential equations are used in nearly every scientific field. In this dissertation we study two types of numerical integration methods, transient methods and pseudo-transient methods. Transient methods for partial differential equations look for time-accurate solutions that explain the evolution of the equation (although a steady state solution may evolve). Pseudo-transient methods look for steady-state solutions of partial differential equations while paying attention to the transient behavior to aid in stability. In contrast, root-finding methods, e.g. line-search methods, look only for a steady-state solution often not paying attention at all to the transient behavior of the problem. Pseudo-transient continuation is a method for solving steady state solutions of partial differential equations, and is used when traditional line-search methods fail to converge or converge to non-physical solutions. The method is a hybrid between implicit Euler and Newton's method where variable step-sizes are used to transfer from one method to the other. We demonstrate the performance of pseudo-transient continuation both numerically and theoretically on a variety of problems. We extend the global convergence theory, which currently covers a class of ordinary differential equations, to include a class of semi-explicit index-1 differential-algebraic equations. We also studied CVode, a transient code for solving nonlinear partial differential equations. In this work, we explain how CVode was extended to allow for a two-grid nonlinear solver. The two-grid solver coarsens a given mesh and solves the nonlinear problem on the coarse mesh, which is then moved back to the fine mesh for refining. This approach can be less expensive than computing the full nonlinear solution on the fine mesh. We explore some of the theoretical and computational issues involved in implementing this method for a radiative transfer problem as might be seen in stellar fusion.

Numerous studies have been conducted to investigate the stability of integration algorithms for linear elastic structures. Studies involving the stability analysis of integration algorithms for nonlinear structures are limited. This paper utilizes discrete control theory to investigate the stability of direct integration algorithms for nonlinear structural dynamics. The direct integration algorithms are represented by a closed-loop block diagram, where the nonlinear restoring force of the structure is related to a varying feedback gain. The root locus method is used to analyze the stability of the closed-loop system for various degrees of nonlinear structural behavior. The well-known methods of the Newmark family of integration algorithms and the Hilber-Hughes-Taylor alpha method, as well as a newly developed integration algorithm, referred to as the CR integration algorithm, are analyzed using the proposed method. It is shown that the stability of an integration algorithm under nonlinear structural behavior is dependent on the poles and zeros of its open-loop discrete transfer function. An unconditionally stable integration algorithm for linear elastic structures is shown not to always remain stable under nonlinear structural behavior.},

Initially, a small time step was chosen. The higher order schemes, Kutta4 and Fehlberg4, provided the worst solution. On the contrary, all the implicit methods, that are only second order accurate, calculated a much more accurate solution. Surprisingly, the energy computed by Kutta4 and Fehlberg4 was found to be practically constant during the integration whereas the energy computed by TR was observed to be affected by a greater error. For a larger time step, the conserving schemes still provided a reasonable answer whereas TR converged to a meaningless solution.},

All these relations are expressed in a unified formulation for the classical beam theory. In the special case of simple beams, a system of four linear ordinary differential equations of first order represents the general mechanical behaviour of a straight beam. These equations are solved using the numerical differential quadrature method (DQM). The application of DQM has the advantages of mathematical consistency and conceptual simplicity. The numerical procedure is simple and gives clear understanding. This systematic way of obtaining influence line, bending moment, shear force diagrams and deformed shape for the beams with geometric and load discontinuities has been discussed in this paper.

Linear stability analysis of SDIRK schemes and some numerical tests have been implemented and the results are presented. As a conclusion, these schemes generally perform well for the solution of the strongly nonlinear damping equations with smaller time steps, while increasing the time step results in oscillations or even instability. More stages or higher orders do not guarantee better performances.

  abstract = {In trying to solve nonlinear partial differential equations with time dependence using the Galerkin method, one ends up with solving nonlinear systems of ordinary differential equations, which are not easily solved. In this thesis we introduce a new iterative method based on eigenfunction expansion to deal with the finite non-linear systems sequentially. We apply the new method to integrate the semi-linear parabolic equation ut=12u+fu,x\&isin;D with homogeneous Dirichlet or Robin boundary conditions. We prove the convergence of the new iterative method, and use it to find the multiple solutions of the system, which are difficult to obtain using the Galerkin method. We next apply the new method to solve a parabolic system of two semi-linear equations. ut=12u+f u,q qt=12 q+gu,q,x\&isin;D with homogeneous boundary conditions Au = 0 and Bv = 0. We prove the convergence of the new method for the case when A = B. If A \&ne; B no analytical statements are obtained. However, the proof of convergence is a sufficient, but not a necessary condition, and numerical calculations indicate that the solution obtained by the new method still converges to that obtained by the Galerkin method for the case when A \&ne; B. We apply the new method to integrate a system in combustion theory, and we are able to find critical (as defined in Chapter 4) solutions for the system, which are not easily found using the Galerkin method. To see that the new method can be applied to more general systems, we use it to integrate the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. 6tu+41+e 264xu+e6 2xu+12 6xu2=0,x\&isin;0,\&ell; We prove the convergence of the iterative method and use it to find the first term of the eigenfunction expansion analytically, and from that we notice that the equation has two solutions, one stable and the other unstable.

  copyright = {Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.},
  issn = {10003290},
  abstract = {To solve atmospheric primitive equations, the finite difference approach would result in numerous problems, compared to the differential equations. Taking the semi-Lagrange model as an example, there exist two difficult problems-the particle trajectory computation and the solutions of the Helmholtz equations. In this study, based on the substitution of atmosphere pressure, the atmospheric primitive equations are linearized within an integral time step, which are broadly seen as ordinary differential equations and can be derived as semi-analytical solutions (SASs). The variables of SASs are continuous functions of time and discretized in a special direction, so the gradient and divergence terms are solved by the difference method. Since the numerical solution of the SASs can be calculated via a highly precise numerical computational method of exponential matrix-the precise integration method, the numerical solution of SASs at any time in the future can be obtained via step-by-step integration procedure. For the SAS methodology, the pressure, as well as the wind vector and displacement, can be obtained without solving the Helmholtz formulations. Compared to the extrapolated method, the SAS is more reasonable as the displacements of the particle are solved via time integration. In order to test the validity of the algorithms, the SAS model is constructed and the same experiment of a non-linear density current as reported by Straka in 1993 is implemented, which contains non-linear dynamics, transient features and fine-scale structures of the fluid flow. The results of the experiment with 50 m spatial resolution show that the SAS model can capture the characters of generation and development process of the Kelvin-Helmholtz shear instability vortex; the structures of the perturbation potential temperature field are very close to the benchmark solutions given by Straka, as well as the structures of the simulated atmosphere pressure and wind field. To further test the convergence of the numerical solution of the SAS model, the 100 m spatial resolution experiment of the non-linear density current is also implemented for comparison. Although the results from both experiments are similar, the former one is better and the property of mass-energy conservation is comparatively reasonable, and furthermore, the SAS model has a convergent property in the numerical solutions. Therefore, the SAS method is a new tool with efficiency for solving the atmospheric primitive equations. \&copy; 2015 Chinese Physical Society.},

  abstract = {Implicit-explicit (IMEX) time stepping methods can efficiently solve differential equations with both stiff and nonstiff components. IMEX Runge-Kutta methods and IMEX linear multistep methods have been studied in the literature. In this paper we study new implicit-explicit methods of general linear type. We develop an order conditions theory for high stage order partitioned general linear methods (GLMs) that share the same abscissae, and show that no additional coupling order conditions are needed. Consequently, GLMs offer an excellent framework for the construction of multi-method integration algorithms. Next, we propose a family of IMEX schemes based on diagonally-implicit multi-stage integration methods and construct practical schemes of order up to three. Numerical results confirm the theoretical findings. \&copy; 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

  doi = {10/dp4mvq},
  abstract = {In the literature, various types of parallel methods for integrating nonstiff initial-value problems for first-order ordinary differential equation have been proposed. The greater part of them are based on an implicit multistage method in which the implicit relations are solved by the predictor-corrector (or fixed point iteration) method. In the predictor-corrector approach the computation of the components of the stage vector iterate can be distributed over s processors, where s is the number of implicit stages of the corrector method. However, the fact that after each iteration the processors have to exchange their just computed results is often mentioned as a drawback, because it implies frequent communication between the processors. Particularly on distributed memory computers, such a fine grain parallelism is not attractive. An alternative approach is based on implicit multistage methods which are such that the implicit stages are already parallel, so that they can be solved independently of each other. This means that only after completion of a step, the processors need to exchange their results. The purpose of this paper is the design of a class of parallel methods for solving nonstiff IVPs. We shall construct explicit methods of order k + 1 with k parallel stages where each stage equation is of Adams-Bashforth type and implicit methods of order k + 2 with k parallel stages which are of Adams-Moulton type. The abscissae in both families of methods are proved to be the Lobatto points, so that the Adams-Bashforth type method can be used as a predictor for the Adams-Moulton-type corrector.},

  issn = {00988847},
  abstract = {It has been shown that the operator-splitting method (OSM) provides explicit and unconditionally stable solutions for quasi-static pseudo-dynamic substructure testing. However, the OSM provides only an explicit target displacement but not an explicit target velocity, so that it is essentially an implicit method for real-time substructure testing (RST) when the velocity-dependent restoring force is considered. This paper proposes a target velocity formulation based on the forward difference of the predicted displacements so as to render the OSM explicit for RST. The stability and accuracy of the resulting OSM-RST algorithm are investigated. It is shown that the OSM-RST is unconditionally stable so long as the non-linear stiffness and damping are of the softening type (i.e. the tangent stiffness and damping never exceed the initial values). The stability of the OSM-RST for structures with infinite tangent damping coefficient or stiffness is also proved, and the stability of the method for MDOF structures with a non-classical damping matrix is demonstrated by an energy criterion. The effects of actuator delay and compensation are analysed based on the bilinear approximation of the actuator step response. Experiments on damped SDOF and MDOF structures verify that the stability of the OSM-RST is preserved when the experimental substructure generates velocity-dependent reaction forces, whereas the stability of real-time substructure tests based on the central difference method is worsened by the damping of the specimen.

  abstract = {The `model-based' algorithms available in the literature are primarily developed for the direct integration of the equations of motion for hybrid simulation in earthquake engineering, an experimental method where the system response is simulated by dividing it into a physical and an analytical domain. The term `model-based' indicates that the algorithmic parameters are functions of the complete model of the system to enable unconditional stability to be achieved within the framework of an explicit formulation. These two features make the model-based algorithms also potential candidates for computations in structural dynamics. Based on the algorithmic difference equations, these algorithms can be classified as either explicit or semi-explicit, where the former refers to the algorithms with explicit difference equations for both displacement and velocity, while the latter for displacement only. The algorithms pertaining to each class are reviewed, and a new family of second-order unconditionally stable parametrically dissipative semi-explicit algorithms is presented. Numerical characteristics of these two classes of algorithms are assessed under linear and nonlinear structural behavior. Representative numerical examples are presented to complement the analytical findings. The analysis and numerical examples demonstrate the advantages and limitations of these two classes of model-based algorithms for applications in structural dynamics.

Five equations are required for determination of these coefficients in each time step. These equations are obtained from initial conditions, satisfying equation of motions at both ends, and weighted residual integration. In this study, four procedures are considered for weight function to be used in the weighted residual integration as; unit weight function, Petrov\textendash{}Galerkin's weight function, least square weight function, and collocation weight function. Due to higher order of acceleration in the proposed method, the results indicate better and more accurate responses. Among the tested functions, the unit weighted function method demonstrated to be non-dissipative and its numerical dispersion showed to be clearly less than the common Newmark's linear acceleration method. Also critical time step duration in stability investigation for weighted function procedure showed to be larger than the critical time step duration obtained by other methods used in the nonlinear structural dynamics problems.},

  abstract = {The present studies on the extension of B-spline mainly focus on Bezier methods and uniform B-spline and are confined to the adjustment role of shape parameters to curves. Researchers pay little attention to nonuniform B-spline. This paper discusses deeply the extension of the quasi-uniform B-spline curves. Firstly, by introducing shape parameters in the basis function, the spline curves are defined in matrix form. Secondly, the application of the shape parameter in shape design is analyzed deeply. With shape parameters, we get another means for adjusting the curves. Meanwhile, some examples are given. Thirdly, we discuss the smooth connection between adjacent B-spline segments in detail and present the adjusting methods. Without moving the control points position, through assigning appropriate value to the shape parameter, C1 continuity of combined spline curves can be realized easily. Results show that the methods are simple and suitable for the engineering application.},

  doi = {10/gcsk8q},
  abstract = {Gaussian quadrature formulas, relative to the Chebyshev weight functions, with multiple nodes and their optimal extensions for computing the Fourier coefficients in expansions of functions with respect to a given system of orthogonal polynomials, are considered. The existence and uniqueness of such quadratures is proved. One of them is a generalization of the well-known Micchelli\textendash{}Rivlin quadrature formula. The others are new. A numerically stable construction of these quadratures is proposed. By determining the absolute value of the difference between these Gaussian quadratures with multiple nodes for the Fourier\textendash{}Chebyshev coefficients and their corresponding optimal extensions, we get the well-known methods for estimating their error. Numerical results are included. These results are a continuation of the recent ones in Bojanov \&amp; Petrova (2009, J. Comput. Appl. Math., 231, 378\textendash{}391) and Milovanovi{\'c} \&amp; Spalevi{\'c} (2014, Math. Comput., 83, 1207\textendash{}1231).},

  abstract = {In this paper a new effective boundary node method is presented for the solution of acoustic problems, directly in time domain, using exponential basis functions (EBFs). Unlike many other methods using boundary information, the final coefficient matrix is sparse. The formulation is well suited for domains whose extent is relatively larger than the distance traveled by the acoustic wave in an increment of time. The EBFs used satisfy the time\textendash{}space governing equation. This helps to choose relatively large time increment and moderate number of boundary points which leads to reduction of computation time. The computation is performed incrementally using a weighted residual in time. Through a series of numerical examples it is shown that the method, when combined with a domain decomposition strategy, is effectively capable of solving various 1D to 3D acoustic problems.},

These systems are very sensitive to initial conditions at each time-iteration level in a numerical algorithm. In this article, we study the behavior of some nonlinear chaotic systems by a new numerical approach based on the concept of Galerkin\textendash{}Petrov time-discretization formulation. Computational algorithms are derived to calculate dynamical behavior of nonlinear chaotic systems. Dynamical systems representing weather prediction model and finance model are chosen as test cases for simulation using the derived algorithms. The obtained results are compared with classical RK-4 and RK-5 methods, and an excellent agreement is achieved. The accuracy and convergence of the method are shown by comparing numerically computed results with the exact solution for two test problems derived from another nonlinear dynamical system in two-dimensional space. It is shown that the derived numerical algorithms have a great potential in dealing with the solution of nonlinear chaotic systems and thus can be utilized to delineate different features and characteristics of their solutions.},

In this paper, 6th-order composite symmetric general linear methods (COSY-GLMs) are constructed using a generalisation of the composition theory associated with Runge\textendash{}Kutta methods (RKMs). A novel aspect of this approach involves a nonlinear transformation which is used to convert the GLM to a canonical form in which its starting and finishing methods are trivial. Numerical experiments include efficiency comparisons to symmetric diagonally-implicit RKMs, where it is shown that COSY-GLMs of the same order typically require half the number of function evaluations, as well as long-time computations of both separable and non-separable Hamiltonian systems which demonstrate the preservation properties of the new methods.},

The obtained results demonstrate that this method is very convenient for solving nonlinear equations and also can be successfully exerted to a lot of practical engineering and physical problems.Keywords:~nonlinear oscillator; Equivalent Linearization Method; weighted averaging},
