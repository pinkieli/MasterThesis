  abstract  = {When solving the equations of structural dynamics using direct time integration methods, algorithmic damping is useful in controlling spurious high-frequency oscillations. Ideally, an algorithm should possess asymptotic annihilation of the high-frequency response, i.e., spurious oscillations in the high frequencies are eliminated after one time step. In this paper, a new class of asymptotic annihilation algorithms for structural dynamics is presented that possesses little numerical dissipation in the low-frequency regime. The algorithms are based upon using finite elements in time. The displacement and velocity fields are interpolated independently using time-discontinuous functions. The equations of motion, displacement-velocity compatibility and the time continuity of displacement and velocity are satisfied weakly. Asymptotic annihilation is achieved by choosing the displacement and velocity fields to be of equal order. Algorithms of any desired order of temporal accuracy can be obtained by appropriate choice of the finite element interpolations in time. An analysis of the proposed class of algorithms is given proving the asymptotic annihilation property and the spectral equivalence of the algorithms to the upper diagonal of the Padé approximation table. Results from finite difference analyses are presented showing the spectral behavior of the algorithms as well as their dissipation and dispersion properties in the low frequency regime.},

  abstract  = { We have developed two finite element techniques with reduced dispersion for linear elastodynamics that are used with explicit time-integration methods. These techniques are based on the modified integration rule for the mass and stiffness matrices and on the averaged mass matrix approaches that lead to the numerical dispersion reduction for linear finite elements. The analytical study of numerical dispersion for the new techniques is carried out in the 1-D, 2-D and 3-D cases. The numerical study of the effectiveness of the dispersion reduction techniques includes two-stage time-integration approach with the filtering stage (developed in our previous papers) that quantifies and removes spurious high-frequency oscillations from numerical results. We have found that in contrast to the standard linear elements with explicit time-integration methods and the lumped mass matrix, the finite element techniques with reduced dispersion yield more accurate results at small time increments (smaller than the stability limit) in the 2D and 3-D cases. The advantages of the new technique are illustrated by the solution of the 1-D and 2-D impact problems. The new approaches with reduced dispersion can be easily implemented into existing finite element codes and lead to significant reduction in computation time at the same accuracy compared with the standard finite element formulations. Finally, we compare the accuracy of the linear elements with reduced dispersion, the spectral low- and high-order elements as well as the isogeometric elements by the solution of the 1-D impact problem. For all these solutions we use two-stage time integration technique with the filtering stage that removes spurious oscillations and allows an accurate comparison of different space discretization techniques used for elastodynamics. It is also interesting to mention that the amount of numerical dissipation at the filtering stage can be used as a quantitative measure for the comparison of accuracy of the different numerical formulations used for elastodynamics.},

It is found that the accuracy is in general of order m — 1 and m — 2 for TDG and BDG methods, respectively, within the time interval. The discrepancy at the initial time is of the same order of accuracy as the other points within the time interval. It is also found that some points within the time interval are of one-order higher in accuracy. These locations for lower-order interpolations are given. To maintain higher-order accuracy at the end of the time interval, it is shown that the forcing excitation should be accurate up to order 2m — 1 and 2m — 2 for TDG and BDG methods, respectively.},

It is found that the order of accuracy for both the Bubnov-Galerkin method and the Petrov-Galerkin method is, in general, m only within the time interval under consideration. It is also found that there are some locations with one order higher in accuracy. Besides, it is shown that for the Petrov-Galerkin method to maintain higher order accuracy at the end of the time interval, the excitation should be accurate up to order 2m.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new framework to construct higher-order accurate time-step                 integration algorithms based on weakly enforcing the differential/integral relation.                 The dependent variable and its time derivatives are assumed to be polynomials of                 equal order. A differential equation is then transformed into an algebraic equation                 directly. The main issue is how to approximate the integral of a polynomial by                 another polynomial of the same degree. Various methods to determine the optimal                 representation (or projection) are considered. It is shown that to reproduce                 numerical results equivalent to the Padé or generalized Padé                 approximations, the coefficients of the optimal polynomial representation are                 related to the weighting parameters derived previously for time-step integration                 algorithms with predetermined coefficients. A special feature for the present                 formulation is that the same procedure can be used to solve first-, second-, and                 even higher-order non-homogeneous initial value problems in a unified manner. The                 resultant algorithms are higher-order accurate and unconditionally A-stable with                 controllable numerical dissipation. It is also shown that for the numerical results                 to maintain higher-order accuracy at the end of a time interval, the higher-order                 terms in the excitation have to be projected as polynomials of lower degree within                 the present framework as well. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the                 validity of the present formulations.},

The resulting time integration algorithm is equivalent to the Newmark method for a restricted but important range of the parameters. The weighted residual treatment of the forcing function permits use of time increments based solely on the expected periods of the structural response, instead of the usual additional restrictions based on the periods of the forcing function. A numerical example is included to illustrate the behaviour of the algorithm for a forced ground motion with both low- and high-frequency components.},

The new approach is analyzed and tested in the context of inexact Newton methods but is also well suited to be applied in the pseudo-transient continuation framework. To validate the strategy and assess its gains in terms of computational costs we seek approximate solutions of the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations at high-Reynolds numbers. In particular we consider the well known 2D lid-driven cavity flow and backward-facing step problem focusing on the efficiency of the time marching strategy. Residual history and computation time are monitored and compared with many fixed and adaptive forcing term choices of reference. },

Comp. Math. 2010; 28:235–260). In that paper, only local convergence was proved. In this paper, we prove a Kantorovich-type semilocal convergence. Then we introduce Newton-HSS methods with a backtracking strategy and analyse their global convergence. Finally, these globally convergent Newton-HSS methods are shown to work well on several typical examples using different forcing terms to stop the inner iterations.

  abstract  = {Today, nearly every undergraduate mathematics program requires at least one semester of real analysis. Often, students consider this course to be the most challenging or even intimidating of all their mathematics major requirements. The primary goal of A Problem Book in Real Analysis is to alleviate those concerns by systematically solving the problems related to the core concepts of most analysis courses. In doing so, the authors hope that learning analysis becomes less taxing and more satisfying.

The wide variety of exercises presented in this book range from the computational to the more conceptual and varies in difficulty. They cover the following subjects: set theory; real numbers; sequences; limits of the functions; continuity; differentiability; integration; series; metric spaces; sequences; and series of functions and fundamentals of topology. Furthermore, the authors define the concepts and cite the theorems used at the beginning of each chapter. A Problem Book in Real Analysis is not simply a collection of problems; it will stimulate its readers to independent thinking in discovering analysis.

Prerequisites for the reader are a robust understanding of calculus and linear algebra.},

This volume offers an unusual collection of problems ― many of them original ― specializing in three topics of mathematical analysis: limits, series, and fractional part integrals. 

The work is divided into three parts, each containing a chapter dealing with a particular problem type as well as a very short section of hints to select problems. The first chapter collects problems on limits of special sequences and Riemann integrals; the second chapter focuses on the calculation of fractional part integrals with a special section called ‘Quickies’ which contains problems that have had unexpected succinct solutions. The final chapter offers the reader an assortment of problems with a flavor towards the computational aspects of infinite series and special products, many of which are new to the literature. Each chapter contains a section of difficult problems which are motivated by other problems in the book. These ‘Open Problems’ may be considered research projects for students who are studying advanced calculus, and which are intended to stimulate creativity and the discovery of new and original methods for proving known results and establishing new ones. 

This stimulating collection of problems is intended for undergraduate students with a strong background in analysis; graduate students in mathematics, physics, and engineering; researchers; and anyone who works on topics at the crossroad between pure and applied mathematics. Moreover, the level of problems is appropriate for students involved in the Putnam competition and other high level mathematical contests.},

The first volume, Topological and Function Spaces © 2011, provided an introduction from scratch to Cp-theory and general topology, preparing the reader for a professional understanding of Cp-theory in the last section of its main text. The second volume, Special Features of Function Spaces © 2014, continued from the first, giving reasonably complete coverage of Cp-theory, systematically introducing each of the major topics and providing 500 carefully selected problems and exercises with complete solutions. This third volume is self-contained and works in tandem with the other two, containing five hundred carefully selected problems and solutions. It can also be considered as an introduction to advanced set theory and descriptive set theory, presenting diverse topics of the theory of function spaces with the topology of point wise convergence, or Cp-theory which exists at the intersection of topological algebra, functional analysis and general topology.},

  abstract  = {This work is a continuation of the first volume published by Springer in 2011, entitled "A Cp-Theory Problem Book: Topological and Function Spaces." The first volume provided an introduction from scratch to Cp-theory and general topology, preparing the reader for a professional understanding of Cp-theory in the last section of its main text. This present volume covers a wide variety of topics in Cp-theory and general topology at the professional level bringing the reader to the frontiers of modern research. The volume contains 500 problems and exercises with complete solutions. It can also be used as an introduction to advanced set theory and descriptive set theory. The book presents diverse topics of the theory of function spaces with the topology of pointwise convergence, or Cp-theory which exists at the intersection of topological algebra, functional analysis and general topology. Cp-theory has an important role in the classification and unification of heterogeneous results from these areas of research. Moreover, this book gives a reasonably complete coverage of Cp-theory through 500 carefully selected problems and exercises. By systematically introducing each of the major topics of Cp-theory the book is intended to bring a dedicated reader from basic topological principles to the frontiers of modern research.},

  abstract  = {Curves and surfaces are objects that everyone can see, and many of the questions that can be asked about them are natural and easily understood. Differential geometry is concerned with the precise mathematical formulation of some of these questions. It is a subject that contains some of the most beautiful and profound results in mathematics yet many of these are accessible to higher-level undergraduates.

Elementary Differential Geometry presents the main results in the differential geometry of curves and surfaces suitable for a first course on the subject. Prerequisites are kept to an absolute minimum – nothing beyond first courses in linear algebra and multivariable calculus – and the most direct and straightforward approach is used throughout. 

New features of this revised and expanded second edition include:

a chapter on non-Euclidean geometry, a subject that is of great importance in the history of mathematics and crucial in many modern developments. The main results can be reached easily and quickly by making use of the results and techniques developed earlier in the book. 

Coverage of topics such as: parallel transport and its applications; map colouring; holonomy and Gaussian curvature.

Around 200 additional exercises, and a full solutions manual for instructors, available via www.springer.com

Praise for the first edition:

"The text is nicely illustrated, the definitions are well-motivated and the proofs are particularly well-written and student-friendly…this book would make an excellent text for an undergraduate course, but could also well be used for a reading course, or simply read for pleasure."

Australian Mathematical Society Gazette

"Excellent figures supplement a good account, sprinkled with illustrative examples."

This book presents elementary methods for analytical modeling and demonstrates the potential for symbolic computational tools to support the development of analytical solutions. 
The author systematically examines several powerful tools of MATLAB® including 2D and 3D animation of geometric images with shadows and colors, transformations using matrices, and then studies more complex geometrical modeling problems related to analysis of curves and surfaces. With over 150 stimulating exercises and problems, this text integrates traditional differential and non-Euclidean geometries with more current computer systems in a practical and user-friendly format. 
This text greatly extends the author’s previous title, Geometry of Curves and Surfaces with Maple (Birkhäuser, © 2000), and has a different focus. In addition to being applications driven and motivated by numerous examples and exercises from real-world fields, the book also contains over 60 percent new material, including new sections with complex numbers, quaternions, matrices and transformations, hyperbolic geometry, fractals, and surface-splines and over 300 figures reproducible using MATLAB® programs. 
This text is an excellent classroom resource or self-study reference for undergraduate students in a variety of disciplines, engineers, computer scientists, and instructors of applied mathematics.},

   Theoretical analysis indicates that the composite algorithmis a
   single-solver algorithm with satisfactory accuracy, unconditional
   stability, and second-order convergence rate. Moreover, without any
   additional parameters, the composite algorithm maintains a symmetric
   effective stiffness matrix and the computational cost is the same as
   that of the trapezoidal rule. And more merits of the proposed algorithm
   are revealed through several representative finite element examples by
   comparing with analytical solutions or solutions provided by other
   numerical techniques. Results show that not only the linear stiff
   problem but also the nonlinear problems involving nonlinearities of
   geometry, contact, and material can be solved efficiently and
   successfully by this composite algorithm. Thus the prospect of its

  abstract                   = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to report the implementation of
   an alternative time integration procedure for the dynamic non-linear
   analysis of structures.
   Design/methodology/approach - The time integration algorithm discussed
   in this work corresponds to a spectral decomposition technique
   implemented in the time domain. As in the case of the modal
   decomposition in space, the numerical efficiency of the resulting
   integration scheme depends on the possibility of uncoupling the
   equations of motion. This is achieved by solving an eigenvalue problem
   in the time domain that only depends on the approximation basis being
   implemented. Complete sets of orthogonal Legendre polynomials are used
   to define the time approximation basis required by the model.
   Findings - A classical example with known analytical solution is
   presented to validate the model, in linear and non-linear analysis. The
   efficiency of the numerical technique is assessed. Comparisons are made
   with the classical Newmark method applied to the solution of both linear
   and non-linear dynamics. The mixed time integration technique presents
   some interesting features making very attractive its application to the
   analysis of non-linear dynamic systems. It corresponds in essence to a
   modal decomposition technique implemented in the time domain. As in the
   case of the modal decomposition in space, the numerical efficiency of
   the resulting integration scheme depends on the possibility of
   uncoupling the equations of motion.
   Originality/value - One of the main advantages of this technique is the
   possibility of considering relatively large time step increments which
   enhances the computational efficiency of the numerical procedure. Due to
   its characteristics, this method is well suited to parallel processing,
   one of the features that have to be conveniently explored in the near
   future.}},

   researchers in different disciplines of science and technology. In this
   paper, implementation of two different wavelet basis functions has been
   comparatively considered for dynamic analysis of structures. For this
   aim, computational technique is developed by using free scale of simple
   Haar wavelet, initially. Later, complex and continuous Chebyshev wavelet
   basis functions are presented to improve the time history analysis of
   structures. Free-scaled Chebyshev coefficient matrix and operation of
   integration are derived to directly approximate displacements of the
   corresponding system. In addition, stability of responses has been
   investigated for the proposed algorithm of discrete Haar wavelet
   compared against continuous Chebyshev wavelet. To demonstrate the
   validity of the wavelet-based algorithms, aforesaid schemes have been
   extended to the linear and nonlinear structural dynamics. The
   effectiveness of free-scaled Chebyshev wavelet has been compared with
   simple Haar wavelet and two common integration methods. It is deduced
   that either indirect method proposed for discrete Haar wavelet or direct
   approach for continuous Chebyshev wavelet is unconditionally stable.
   Finally, it is concluded that numerical solution is highly benefited by
   the least computation time involved and high accuracy of response,
   particularly using low scale of complex Chebyshev wavelet.}},

   and nonlinear multi-degree-of-freedom systems. It applies also to large
   systems of second order differential equations with fully populated, non
   symmetric coefficient matrices as well as to equations with variable
   coefficients. The proposed method is based on the concept of the analog
   equation, which converts the coupled N equations into a set of single
   term uncoupled second order ordinary quasi-static differential equations
   under appropriate fictitious loads, unknown in the first instance. The
   fictitious loads are established from the integral representation of the
   solution of the substitute single term equations. The method is simple
   to implement. It is self starting, unconditionally stable and accurate
   and conserves energy. It performs well when large deformations and long
   time durations are considered and it can be used as a practical method
   for integration of the equations of motion in cases where widely used
   time integration procedures, e. g. Newmark's, become unstable. Several
   examples are presented, which demonstrate the efficiency of the method.
   The method can be straightforward extended to evolution equations of

  abstract                   = {{In this study, we consider Initial Value Problems (IVPs) for strongly
   nonlinear dynamical systems, and study numerical methods to analyze
   short as well as long-term responses. Dynamical systems characterized by
   a system of second-order nonlinear ordinary differential equations
   (ODEs) are recast into a system of nonlinear first order ODEs in mixed
   variables of positions as well as velocities. For each discrete-time
   interval Radial Basis Functions (RBFs) are assumed as trial functions
   for the mixed variables in the time domain. A simple collocation method
   is developed in the time-domain, with Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto nodes as
   RBF source points as well as collocation points. Three numerical
   examples are provided to compare the present algorithm with explicit as
   well implicit methods in terms of accuracy, required size of
   time-interval (or step) and computational cost. The present algorithm is
   compared against, the second order central difference method, the
   classical Runge-Kutta method, the adaptive Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg method,
   the Newmark-beta and the Hilber-Hughes-Taylor Methods. First the highly
   nonlinear Duffing oscillator is analyzed and the solutions obtained from
   all algorithms are compared against the analytical solution for free
   oscillation at long times. A Duffing oscillator with impact forcing
   function is next solved. Solutions are compared against numerical
   solutions from state of the art ODE45 numerical integrator for long
   times. Finally, a nonlinear 3-DOF system is presented and results from
   all algorithms are compared against ODE45. It is shown that the present
   RBF-Coll algorithm is very simple, efficient and very accurate in
   obtaining the solution for the nonlinear IVP. Since other presented
   methods require a much smaller step size and higher computational cost,
   the proposed algorithm is advantageous and has promising applications in
   solving nonlinear dynamical systems. The extension of the present
   algorithm to orbit propagation problems with perturbations, will be
   pursued in our future studies. Issues of numerical stability for various
   time-integrators will also be explored in future studies.}},

   in various domain of science. Particularly, engineers are interested to
   the wavelet solution method in the time series analysis. Fundamentally,
   seismic responses of structures against time history loading such as an
   earthquake, illustrates optimum capability of systems. In this paper, a
   procedure using particularly discrete Haar wavelet basis functions is
   introduced, to solve dynamic equation of motion. In the proposed
   approach, a straightforward formulation in a fluent manner is derived
   from the approximation of the displacements. For this purpose, Haar
   operational matrix is derived and applied in the dynamic analysis. It's
   free-scaled matrix converts differential equation of motion to the
   algebraic equations. It is shown that accuracy of dynamic responses
   relies on, access of load in the first step, before piecewise analysis
   added to the technique of equation solver in the last step for large
   scale of wavelet. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this scheme,
   improved formulations are extended to the linear and nonlinear
   structural dynamic analysis. The validity and effectiveness of the
   developed method is verified with three examples. The results were
   compared with those from the numerical methods such as Duhamel
   integration, Runge-Kutta and Wilson-theta method.}},

  abstract                   = {{This paper presents the Expectation Maximization algorithm (EM) applied
   to operational modal analysis of structures. The EM algorithm is a
   general-purpose method for maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) that in
   this work is used to estimate state space models. As it is well known,
   the MLE enjoys some optimal properties from a statistical point of view,
   which make it very attractive in practice. However, the EM algorithm has
   two main drawbacks: its slow convergence and the dependence of the
   solution on the initial values used. This paper proposes two different
   strategies to choose initial values for the EM algorithm when used for
   operational modal analysis: to begin with the parameters estimated by
   Stochastic Subspace Identification method (SSI) and to start using
   random points.
   The effectiveness of the proposed identification method has been
   evaluated through numerical simulation and measured vibration data in
   the context of a benchmark problem. Modal parameters (natural
   frequencies, damping ratios and mode shapes) of the benchmark structure
   have been estimated using SSI and the EM algorithm. On the whole, the
   results show that the application of the EM algorithm starting from the
   solution given by SSI is very useful to identify the vibration modes of
   a structure, discarding the spurious modes that appear in high order
   models and discovering other hidden modes. Similar results are obtained
   using random starting values, although this strategy allows us to
   analyze the solution of several starting points what overcome the
   dependence on the initial values used. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   acoustic or elastic, scalar or vector-valued waves in unbounded domains
   of arbitrary geometry is proposed. It is based on an improved
   continued-fraction solution of the dynamic stiffness matrix of an
   unbounded medium. The coefficient matrices of the continued-fraction
   expansion are determined recursively from the scaled boundary finite
   element equation in dynamic stiffness. They are normalised using a
   matrix-valued scaling factor, which is chosen such that the robustness
   of the numerical procedure is improved. The resulting continued-fraction
   solution is suitable for systems with many DOFs. It converges over the
   whole frequency range with increasing order of expansion and leads to
   numerically more robust formulations in the frequency domain and time
   domain for arbitrarily high orders of approximation and large-scale
   systems. Introducing auxiliary variables, the continued-fraction
   solution is expressed as a system of linear equations in i? in the
   frequency domain. In the time domain, this corresponds to an equation of
   motion with symmetric, banded and frequency-independent coefficient
   matrices. It can be coupled seamlessly with finite elements. Standard
   procedures in structural dynamics are directly applicable in the
   frequency and time domains. Analytical and numerical examples
   demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method to an existing
   approach and its suitability for time-domain simulations of large-scale

   conventional time integration methods are used to compute the response
   of a structure subjected to a dynamic loading with rapid changes or load
   discontinuity. To overcome this drawback, this study proposed a fast,
   fourth-order accurate step-by-step time integration (FASSTI) algorithm
   that is unconditionally stable and allows larger time steps for linear
   dynamic problems. From the stability and accuracy analysis, it is shown
   that the FASSTI algorithm retains the features of unconditional
   stability, accuracy, and fast convergence than the Newmark method. As a
   first test, a closed-form solution of an excited single degree of
   freedom (SDOF) system is derived and used to verify the reliability of
   the present algorithm in solving linear dynamic problems. In the
   numerical examples, the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method
   is demonstrated in the solution of the dynamic response of an SDOF
   system under a series of impulse-type forces.},

   considered as important technique to resolve computational resource
   problems. In addition, the efforts to advance an efficiency of reduction
   scheme leads to the development of the multilevel system condensation
   (MLSC) which is initially based on the two-level condensation scheme
   (TLCS). This scheme was proposed for approximating the lower eigenmodes
   which represent the global behavior of the structures through the
   element-level energy estimation. The MLSC combines the multi-level
   substructuring scheme with the previous TLCS for enhancement of
   efficiency which is related to computer memory and computing time. The
   present study focuses on the implementation of the MLSC on the direct
   time response analysis and the frequency response analysis of structural
   dynamic problems. For the transient time response analysis, the MLSC is
   combined with the Newmark's time integration scheme. Numerical examples

   B-spline interpolation polynomials to solve linear and nonlinear dynamic
   equation of motion governing single degree of freedom (SDOF) systems. In
   the proposed approach, a straightforward formulation was derived from
   the approximation of displacement with B-spline basis in a fluent
   manner. In this way, there is no need to use a special pre-starting
   procedure to commence solving the problem. Actually, this method lies in
   the case of conditionally stable methods. A simple step-by-step
   algorithm is implemented and presented to calculate dynamic response of
   SDOF systems. The validity and effectiveness of the proposed method is
   demonstrated with four examples. The results were compared with those
   from the numerical methods such as Duhamel integration, Linear
   Acceleration and also Exact method. The comparison shows that the
   proposed method is a fast and simple procedure with trivial
   computational effort and acceptable accuracy exactly like the Linear
   Acceleration method. But its power point is that its time consumption is
   notably less than the Linear Acceleration method especially in the
   nonlinear analysis.}},

   to algorithm of two-step level-symmetric LS-2 integration method
   designed for numerical solution of stiff structural dynamic problems. LS
   integration methods were presented in original work of the author in
   {[}International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering 71 (2007)
   1598-1632]. These methods are L-stable in sense of ``Maximal Damping of
   High-frequency Accelerations (MDHA){''}. Family of unconditionally
   stable implicit LS methods provides strong dissipation of high-frequency
   modes and has so-called U0-V0 overshoot properties (zero-order
   displacement and velocity overshoots). LS methods belong to generalized
   linear multi-step class of integration methods with second derivative
   (GLMSd2) and employ direct use of non-modified dynamic equations.
   Besides, LS methods show the identical rate of convergence in
   displacements, velocities and accelerations or, in other words, they are
   ``symmetrically converging{''} (SC) algorithms in all three integration
   levels. In the current paper, two-step Lambda integration method is
   developed. This method also has U0-V0 and SC features and depends on a
   parameter lambda such that as lambda is varied from 0 to 1, the method
   is varied from LS-2 method with MDHA property of dissipation to Newmark
   method of average acceleration. Since latter method has no numerical
   damping, dissipation can be changed from maximum to zero. This provides
   wide functionality of Lambda method. Lambda integration method is
   unconditionally stable and has the second order of accuracy. Numerical
   dissipation, phase dispersion and high-frequency damping of this
   ``direct time{''} two-step method are compared with similar properties
   of contemporary ``weighted residual{''} one-step integration methods,
   such as Hilber-Hughes-Taylor (HHT-alpha) method and generalized single
   step single solve optimal (GSSSS-optimal) method. (C) 2010 IMACS.

  abstract                   = {{The scaled boundary finite element method is extended to solve problems
   of structural dynamics. The dynamic stiffness matrix of a bounded
   (finite) domain is obtained as a continued fraction solution for \&
   scaled boundary finite element equation. The inertial effect at high
   frequencies is modeled by high-order terms of the continued fraction
   without introducing an internal mesh. By using this solution and
   introducing auxiliary variables, the equation of motion of the bounded
   domain is expressed in high-order static stiffness and mass matrices.
   Standard procedures in structural dynamics can be applied to perform
   modal analyses and transient response analyses directly in the time
   domain.. Numerical examples for modal and direct time-domain analyses
   are presented. Rapid convergence is observed as the order of continued
   fraction increases. A guideline for selecting the order of continued
   fraction is proposed and validated. High computational efficiency is
   demonstrated for problems with stress singularity. Copyright (C) 2008

   paper and its companion, Part II. Because there is virtually no
   application of the NNMs to large-scale engineering structures, these
   papers are an attempt to highlight several aspects that might drive
   their development in the future. Specifically, we support that (i)
   numerical methods for the continuation of periodic solutions pave the
   way for an effective and practical computation of NNMs, and (ii)
   time-frequency analysis is particularly suitable for the analysis of the
   resulting dynamics. Another objective of the present paper is to
   describe, in simple terms, and to illustrate the fundamental properties
   of NNMs. This is achieved to convince the structural dynamicist not
   necessarily acquainted with them that they are a useful framework for
   the analysis of nonlinear vibrating structures. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract                   = {{The introduction of algorithmic dissipation into conservative time
   integration algorithms is addressed in two steps. The problem is
   formulated in state-space, and it is demonstrated that the use of two
   balanced dissipation terms-one in the equation of motion and the other
   in the relation between the state-space variables-can produce
   dissipation that increases monotonically with the modal frequency. This
   formulation is only partially satisfactory, because it leads to
   dissipation also in the low-frequency range. A substantially improved
   form of algorithmic dissipation is then developed by representing the
   two balanced dissipation terms via auxiliary state-space variables
   related to the displacement and velocity increments by a first-order
   filter. The filter technique retains the high-frequency behavior of the
   original balanced algorithm, but reduces the low-frequency dissipation
   from first order in the frequency to third order. Energy balance
   equations are derived, and the behavior of the two algorithms is
   described by detailed spectral analysis with explicit asymptotic results
   directly in terms of the damping parameter of the algorithms. Both
   algorithms satisfy full symmetry of displacement and normalized velocity
   variables for the free algorithmically damped vibration of any single
   mode and, therefore, exhibit monotonic transients without `overshoot'
   effects. It is also demonstrated how the algorithm can be arranged in
   `single solve' format, where only the displacement update requires a
   matrix equation solution, while the velocity and the auxiliary
   state-space variables are updated subsequently in each time step by
   simple vector relations with scalar coefficients. Copyright (c) 2007

  abstract                   = {{The time-parallel framework for constructing parallel implicit
   time-integration algorithms (PITA) is revisited in the specific context
   of linear structural dynamics and near-real-time computing. The concepts
   of decomposing the time-domain in time-slices whose boundaries define a
   coarse time-grid, generating iteratively seed values of the solution on
   this coarse time-grid, and using them to time-advance the solution in
   each time-slice with embarrassingly parallel time-integrations are
   maintained. However. the Newton-based corrections of the seed values,
   which so far have been computed in PITA and related approaches on the
   coarse time-grid, are eliminated to avoid artificial resonance and
   numerical instability. Instead, the jumps of the solution on the coarse
   time-grid are addressed by a projector which makes their propagation on
   the fine time-grid computationally feasible while avoiding artificial
   resonance and numerical instability. The new PITA framework is
   demonstrated for a complex structural dynamics problem from the aircraft
   industry. Its potential for near-real-time computing is also highlighted
   with the solution of a relatively small-scale problem on a Linux cluster
   system. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   fourth-order. An optional high-frequency algorithmic damping is
   constructed by optimal combination of three different damping matrices,

   to a modified form of the undamped algorithm with scalar weights oil
   some of the matrices introducing damping of fourth-order in the
   frequency. Thus, the low-frequency response is Virtually undamped, and
   the algorithm remains third-order accurate even when algorithmic damping
   is included. The accuracy of the algorithm is illustrated by an
   application to pulse propagation in all elastic medium, where the
   algorithmic damping is Used to reduce dispersion Clue to the spatial

   Its key components are a fluid time-integrator that is provably
   second-order time-accurate on moving grids, the midpoint rule for
   advancing in time the solution of the structural dynamics equations of
   motion, a second-order structure predictor for bypassing the
   inner-iterations encountered in strongly-coupled solution procedures,
   and a carefully designed algorithm for time-integrating the motion of
   the fluid-mesh. Following this methodology, two different
   loosely-coupled schemes are constructed for the solution of transient
   nonlinear FSI problems and proved to be second-order time-accurate.
   Three-dimensional numerical results pertaining to the simulation of the
   aeroelastic response to a gravity excitation of a complete F-16
   configuration are also presented. In addition to confirming the
   theoretical results discussed in this paper, these numerical results
   highlight a very stable behavior of the designed loosely-coupled

   for non-linear dynamics. The procedure is based on a cheap iterative
   algorithm, which is rather different from previous efforts. In fact, the
   algorithm is designed so that the corrected solutions inherit the
   desired stability and dissipative properties and the iterations serve
   only to improve accuracy. Some numerical tests illustrate the good
   performance of the present procedure, which appears to be competitive
   with the available implementations of time discontinuous Galerkin
   methods. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   set of expected values of the model's invariant distributions. Also,
   under a contractivity condition on the dynamics, we establish error

   system (MS-TMM), discrete time transfer matrix method (DT-TMM) and the
   numerical integration procedure. It does not need the global dynamics
   equations for the study of multibody system dynamics. It has the
   modeling flexibility and a small size of matrices, and can be applied to
   a wide range of problems including multi-rigid-body system dynamics and
   multi-flexible-body system dynamics. This method is simple,
   straightforward, practical, and provides a powerful tool for the study
   of multibody system dynamics. Formulations of the method as well as some
   numerical examples of multi-rigid-body system dynamics and
   multi-flexible-body system dynamics to validate the method are given.}},

   assume that A, B and C are large, sparse, symmetric matrices, as is the
   case in several application problerris. In particular, we focus on the
   following structured right-hand side, f (sigma)= F Phi(sigma), where F
   is a (tall) rectangular matrix whose entries are independent of a. We
   propose to approximate the solution x = x(sigma) by means of a
   projection onto a single vector subspace, and a subsequent solution of
   the reduced dimension problem, for all values of interest of the
   parameter sigma. Numerical experiments report the effectiveness of our
   approach on real application problems. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley \&

  abstract                   = {{The Newmark method for the numerical integration of second order
   equations has been extensively used and studied along the past fifty
   years for structural dynamics and various fields of mechanical
   engineering. Easy implementation and nice properties of this method and
   its derivatives for linear problems are appreciated but the main
   drawback is the treatment of discontinuities. Zienkiewicz proposed an
   approach using finite element concept in time, which allows a new look
   at the Newmark method. The idea of this paper is to propose, thanks to
   this approach, the use of a time partition of the unity method denoted
   Time Extended Finite Element Method (TX-FEM) for improved numerical
   simulations of time discontinuities. An enriched basis of shape
   functions in time is used to capture with a good accuracy the
   non-polynomial part of the solution. This formulation allows a suitable
   form of the time-stepping formulae to study stability and energy
   conservation. The case of an enrichment with the Heaviside function is
   developed and can be seen as an alternative approach to time
   discontinuous Galerkin method (T-DGM), stability and accuracy properties
   of which can be derived from those of the TX-FEM. Then Space and Time
   X-FEM (STX-FEM) are combined to obtain a unified space-time
   discretization. This combined STX-FEM appears to be a suitable technique
   for space-time discontinuous problems like dynamic crack propagation or
   other applications involving moving discontinuities. Copyright (c) 2005

   and presented in this paper. Numerical characteristics of this explicit
   method for linear elastic systems are almost the same as those of the
   constant average acceleration method while for a nonlinear system it is
   more efficient in computing than for the constant average acceleration
   method. This explicit method integrates the most promising advantages
   possessed by the explicit and implicit methods. No limitation on the
   time step in satisfying the stability limit, which is the most important
   property for an implicit method, is theoretically proved for this
   explicit method. Furthermore, the avoidance of solving any implicit
   system or using any iterative procedure, which usually brings
   considerable simplification in practical applications for explicit
   methods, leads to the very low cost of one explicit step. Thus, the
   computational effort can be significantly reduced when compared to
   implicit methods in each time step. Consequently, this explicit method
   can be used to solve dynamic problems efficiently due to the
   unconditional stability and the very low cost of explicit steps. Rough
   guidelines with regards to the selection of a time step in achieving
   accurate solutions for the constant average acceleration method are also
   appropriate for the proposed explicit method.}},

   numerical explicit time integration algorithms used in the domain of
   shock and impact. Numerical simulation of such problems, with explicit
   algorithms for time integration, involves minute time steps for reasons
   of stability. Consequently, due to spatial discretization, very high
   numerical frequencies are found in the final solution in displacement or
   stress. Usually, the high frequencies and mode shapes of the spatially
   discretized equations do not accurately represent the behavior of the
   original problem. It has been proven that algorithms such as these of
   Chung-Lee, Zhai, HHT, Tchamwa-Wielgosz and the central difference
   method, are useful in solving problems including high-speed phenomena.
   The consistency, the different regions of stability, but also the
   ability of each numerical scheme to smooth very high frequencies are
   compared. Finally, the integration schemes are implemented in the
   HEREZH+ + finite element code developed at the LG2M laboratory
   {[}httpHwww.-lg2m.univ-ubs.fr]. For some simple problems, the solutions
   obtained from HEREZH + + with these different schemes are compared with
   continuous and discretized theoretical solutions. Conclusions are
   independent of the problems and can be applied to more complex geometry.
   For instance, following these simulations, it seems that the
   Tchamwa-Wielgosz and the Chung-Lee algorithms are particularly efficient
   in smoothing the highest frequencies. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   governing stochastic differential equations (SDE-s). Detailed estimates
   of local and global error orders for the response variables are provided
   in terms of the given time step size, h. While higher order Newmark
   methods lead to higher accuracies, far less random variables need to be
   modeled in the lower order methods to make it much more attractive from
   a computational point of view. For the specific case of a linear
   dynamical system, the stochastic Newmark map is used to obtain a closed
   form map for computing the temporal evolution of the response
   co-variance matrix. A host of numerical illustrations, covering linear
   and non-linear, single- and multi-degree-of-freedom dynamical systems,
   are provided to bring out the advantages and possible weaknesses of the
   methods proposed. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   conditionally stable, is generally thought to be the most adapted. Such
   an algorithm presents the advantage of being noniterative while, the
   contact configuration evolves rapidly, and the conditional stability is
   not a disadvantage since time steps must be small enough anyway for an
   accurate computation. But during the springback simulation, an implicit
   method, which is iterative, presents the advantage of unconditional
   stability. The optimal solution is then to have both implicit and
   explicit methods readily available in the same code and to be able to
   switch automatically from one to the other. Criteria that decide to
   switch from a method to another, depending on the current dynamic, have
   been developed. Implicit restarting conditions are also proposed that
   annihilate numerical oscillations resulting from an explicit

   procedure is based on a simple and low-cost iterative scheme, which is
   designed not as a mere solution algorithm, but rather as a method to
   generate improved approximations to the exact solution. The corrected
   solutions inherit the desired stability and dissipative properties from
   the target solution, while accuracy is improved by iterations. Indeed,
   no more than two iterations are shown to be needed. The resultant
   algorithm leads to remarkable computational savings and can be easily
   implemented into existing finite element codes. Numerical tests confirm
   that the present procedure possesses many attractive features for

   on a simple and low-cost iterative procedure which is used to implement
   a set of higher-order methods with controllable dissipation. A sequence
   of improved solutions is obtained which correspond to algorithms
   offering an effective compromise between the efficiency of Norsett
   methods and the accuracy of Pade methods. Moreover, a direct control
   over high-frequency dissipation is possible by means of an algorithmic
   parameter. Numerical tests are reported which confirm that this set of
   algorithms is really attractive for linear dynamic analysis. Copyright

   time. The improved algorithm employs the Gauss-Seidel method to
   calculate iteratively the solutions that exist in the numerical

   Previous authors have employed the box method, a finite-difference

   method has significant stability problems, however, and thus is not well
   suited to this highly nonlinear problem. We illustrate these stability
   problems and propose a new time integration procedure based on the
   generalized-alpha method. The new method exhibits superior stability
   properties compared to the box method and other algorithms such as
   backward differences and trapezoidal rule. Of four time integration
   methods tested, the generalized-alpha algorithm was the only method that
   produced a stable solution for the three-dimensional whirling motions of
   a hanging chain driven by harmonic linear horizontal motion at the top.}},

   require the description of the local parameters of the mechanical model.
   The probability model is deduced from the use of the entropy
   optimization principle. whose available information is constituted of
   the algebraic properties related to the generalized mass, damping, and
   stiffness matrices which have to he positive-definite symmetric
   matrices, and the knowledge of these matrices for the mean reduced
   matrix model. An explicit construction and representation of the
   probability model have been obtained and are very well suited to
   algebraic calculus and to Monte Carlo numerical simulation in order to
   compute the transient responses of structures submitted to impulsive
   loads. The fundamental properties related to the convergence of the
   stochastic solution with respect to the dimension of the random reduced
   matrix model are analyzed. Finally, an example is presented. (C) 2001

   43 (1992) 757). However, in contrast to the presentation given in that
   reference, the current approach extends the critical stress update
   formula to encompass generic stored energy functions for the
   hyperelastic continuum, in a manner which also allows for quadratically
   convergent Newton-Raphson solution of the nonlinear algorithmic
   equations. Numerical examples using a Neo-Hookean material model are
   given to illustrate the excellent performance of the proposed scheme.
   Not only is the new algorithm guaranteed to be second-order accurate and
   unconditionally stable in the fully nonlinear regime (as are other
   energy-momentum strategies), but also the approach advocated is
   demonstrated to be more robust and versatile than its predecessors. (C)

  abstract                   = {{The Iterative Group Implicit (IGI) algorithm is developed for the
   parallel solution of general structural dynamic problems. In this method
   the original structure is partitioned into a number of a subdomains.
   Each subdomain is solved independently and therefore concurrently, using
   any traditional direct solution method. The IGI algorithm is an
   extension of the Group Implicit (GI) algorithm, and similarly to that
   method compatibility of the interface degrees of freedom is restored
   using a mass averaging rule. However, unlike the GI algorithm, in the
   IGI algorithm an iterative procedure is devised to restore equilibrium
   at the interface degrees of freedom. The IGI method has the same
   algorithmic characteristics as the underlying solution method used to
   solve each subdomain. Furthermore, the solution obtained by this method,
   once the iteration converges, is the same as the one obtained if the
   subdomain solution method is used to solve the whole structure.
   Numerical studies are carried out which demonstrate that the performance
   of the IGI algorithm is superior to that of the GI algorithm both in
   terms of accuracy and efficiency. Finally, the IGI method is highly
   modular and scalable, and therefore very well suited for distributed and
   parallel computing. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   focused on the solution of the complex system of equations needed for
   each analyzed frequency. Strategies for transforming the system into the
   ``shifted{''} form (T - sigmaI)z = d are proposed and discussed, a where
   rr is related to the frequency. For two formulations of the shifted
   system the performance of some Krylov sub-space iterative solvers is
   tested and compared to that of a multi-frontal direct method. Advantage
   is taken of the shifted form in solving simultaneously a large number of
   systems resulting from different values of the shift (frequency).
   Numerical experiments on some prototype structural dynamics problems are
   reported. the results shown demonstrate how the devised strategies for
   the iterative solution can outperform, in many cases, the direct solver.

  abstract                   = {{The use of an incomplete iterative solver aimed at approximating
   solution of equilibrium equation resulting from the finite element
   semidiscretization in space is studied. Our approach is motivated by the
   fact that: (i) the effective stiffness matrix is well conditioned
   because of the stabilizing effect of the diagonally dominated mass
   matrix, (ii) the dominance of the temporal error in implicit
   computations with large step size, and (iii) the utilization of a class
   of iterative methods where the primary computational cost is associated
   with a construction of the preconditioner rather than with an iterative
   process. One of the primary goals of the present manuscript is to
   control the temporal and the equilibrium solution errors and to give
   their a posteriori estimates. Numerical experiments reveal that the
   computational cost of three cycles conducted with the Generalized
   Aggregation Multilevel solver {[}1-4] is comparable to a single back
   substitution on the source grid, while the resulting equilibrium
   solution error is negligible compared with the local temporal error.

   multiple solutions. Therefore, additional information, such as the
   locations of the unknown forces, has to be supplied a priori in order to
   make a unique solution possible. The present study focuses on cases
   where such information is not readily available. First it is shown that,
   given (tentatively) the spatial shape and position of the load the Betti
   reciprocal theorem together with a reference load case may be used to
   calculate the required magnitude of the unknown load so that the
   response fits the measurement data as well as possible in a defined
   sense. In this manner a large number of trial loads may be evaluated
   with only little computational effort, since no equation system needs to
   be solved. Second, the situation where several loads, each reproducing
   the same measurement data, have been identified is investigated An
   optimization problem with added discrete masses as design variables is
   suggested. The solution of this this problem yields a structure such
   that each set of responses generated by each one of the previously
   identified loads is clearly distinguishable at the transducer positions.
   The proposed method is a novel approach and should be useful in the load
   identification problem for an existing structure. A numerical example
   illustrates the application of the method.}},

   updating for structural dynamic applications and show how the problem
   with little effort may be projected onto a subspace spanned by for
   instance, a few eigenvectors of the initial model. Because the subspace
   dimension is much smaller than the space spanned by the finite element
   basis, the subsequent correlation can be conducted speedily, although
   large changes from the initial design may require the subspace basis to
   be updated. The proposed method can conveniently be used for
   substructured models and, in addition, makes interactive design changes

   problems is presented. The second-order differential equations for
   dynamic problems are manipulated directly. A general damping matrix is
   considered. The transient responses are expressed in terms of the
   steady-state responses, the given initial conditions and the
   step-response and impulsive-response matrices. The steady-state
   responses for various types of excitations are readily obtainable. The
   computation of the step-response and impulsive-response matrices and
   their time derivatives are studied in this paper. A direct computation
   of these matrices using the Taylor series solutions is not efficient
   when the time-step size Delta t is not small. In this paper, the
   recurrence formulae relating the response matrices at t = Delta t to
   those at t = Delta t/2 are constructed. A recursive procedure is
   proposed to evaluate these matrices at t = Delta t from the matrices at
   t = Delta t/2(m). The matrices at t = Delta t/2(m) are obtained from the
   Taylor series solutions. To improve the computational efficiency, the
   relations between the response matrices and their time derivatives are
   investigated. In addition, these matrices are expressed in terms of two
   symmetric matrices that can also be evaluated recursively. Besides, from
   the physical point of view, these matrices should be banded for small
   Delta t. Both the stability and accuracy characteristics of the present
   algorithm are studied. Three numerical examples are used to illustrate
   the highly precise and stable algorithm. (C) 1997 John Wiley \& Sons,

  abstract                   = {{Since the trapezoidal rule was originally proposed as the constant
   average acceleration method by Newmark, it has been modified to various
   forms. However, most of the modifications were limited to its numerical
   coefficients and, as a result, little change in the characteristics was
   obtained like numerical dissipation with the loss of accuracy. In this
   work, the constant average acceleration, which is a fundamental feature
   of the trapezoidal rule, is investigated and generalized. Using the
   generalization of average acceleration concept, a higher-order accurate
   and unconditionally stable time-integration method is developed.
   The stability analysis is carried out for a system of single, degree of
   freedom. The analysis proves that the present method is unconditionally
   stable. To observe the accuracy of the method, several numerical tests
   are performed and the results are compared with the results from the
   trapezoidal rule and the exact solution. From the numerical tests, it
   has been known that the present method has a higher order accuracy.}},

  abstract                   = {For computational dynamics problems, direct time integration and mode
   superposition are the most widely employed approaches. Of the two,
   direct time stepping methods have been quite popular in many commercial
   codes because of their various inherent advantages. However, for
   numerous engineering applications, mode superposition techniques
   continue to be the choice of many analysts, especially for linear
   systems and for long time responses. To date, much progress has been
   made in the development and understanding of direct time integration
   methods for computational dynamics problems encountered in engineering.
   Besides investigations encompassing accuracy and stability properties of
   these time integration schemes, the related developments include single
   step, multi-step, mixed and/or variable time integration features and
   the like.
   Unlike past practices customarily employed for computational dynamics,
   the present paper introduces a new virtual-pulse (VIP) time integral
   methodology which offers several attractive and effective features. The
   proposed method possesses a unique solution methodology of its own, thus
   avoiding the need to employ any existing time stepping methods. The
   present paper primarily serves to lay down the fundamental developments
   towards establishing the theoretical basis via new perspectives for
   subsequent applications to general computational structural dynamics.
   However, for expository purposes, attention is confined only to linear
   structural dynamic systems in this paper; and Rayleigh damping is
   considered here, although non-Rayleigh damping can be readily permitted
   but is not described here. As a consequence, the characteristics of the
   methodology include (1) an explicit unconditionally stable
   representation, (2) second-order accuracy, (3) much less algorithmic
   damping than direct time integration methods advocated in existing
   commercial codes; if an undamped system is considered, the algorithmic
   damping is zero, (4) the relative period error is zero, and (5)
   self-starting features. Theoretical details of the developments, the
   stability and accuracy characteristics are described. Illustrative
   numerical examples are presented to validate the proposed methodology
   far computational dynamic problems.},

  abstract                   = {This paper explores a Reproducing Kernel Particle Method (RKPM) which
   incorporates several attractive features. The emphasis is away from
   classical mesh generated elements in favour of a mesh free system which
   only requires a set of nodes or particles in space. Using a Gaussian
   function or a cubic spline function, flexible window functions are
   implemented to provide refinement in the solution process; It also
   creates the ability to analyse a specific frequency range in dynamic
   problems reducing the computer time required. This advantage is achieved
   through an increase in the critical time step when the frequency range
   is low and a large window is used. The stability of the window function
   as well as the critical time step formula are investigated to provide
   insight into RKPMs. The predictions of the theories are confirmed
   through numerical experiments by performing reconstructions of given
   functions and solving elastic and elastic-plastic one-dimensional (1-D)
   bar problems for both small and large deformation as well as three 2-D
   large deformation non-linear elastic problems. Numerical and theoretical
   results show the proposed reproducing kernel interpolation functions
   satisfy the consistency conditions and the critical time step
   prediction; furthermore, the RKPM provides better stability than Smooth
   Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH)methods. In contrast with what has been
   reported in SPH literature, we do not find any tensile instability with
   RKPMs.},

   The method, which is based on the block Lanczos algorithm, is developed
   for multiple low rank modifications to a system and calculates a few
   selected eigenpairs. Given the solution to the original system Ax =
   lambdax, procedures are developed for the modified standard eigenvalue
   problem (A + DELTSA)xBAR = lambdaxBAR, where (1) DELTAA =
   SIGMA(j)BS(j)B(T), where S(j) = S(j)T is-an-element-of R(pxp), p much
   less than n and B is-an-element-of R(nxp) is constant for all the
   perturbations S(j). (2) DELTAA = SIGMA(i)SIGMA(j) B(i)S(j)B(i)T, where
   B(i) is-an-element-of R(nxp) may vary with the pertubations S(j).
   The procedures are then extended for the reciprocal and generalized

   technique for evaluating the natural frequencies and modes from
   frequency-dependent eigenproblems in structural dynamics. The new
   solution technique is used in conjunction with a mixed finite element
   modelling procedure which utilizes both the polynomial and
   frequency-dependent displacement fields in formulating the system
   matrices. The method is well suited to the solution of large-scale
   problems.
   The new solution methodology presented here is based on the ability to
   evaluate a specific set of parameterized non-linear eigenvalue curves at
   given values of the parameter through an implicitly restarted Lanczos
   technique. Numerical examples illustrate that the implicitly restarted
   Lanczos method with secant interpolation accurately evaluates the exact
   natural frequencies and modes of the non-linear eigenproblem and
   verifies that the new eigensolution technique coupled with the mixed
   finite element modelling procedure is more accurate than the
   conventional finite element models. In addition, the eigenvalue
   technique presented here is shown to be far more computationally
   efficient on large-scale problems than the determinant search techniques
   traditionally employed for solving exact vibration problems.},

   posteriori error estimate for the Newmark method in structural dynamic
   analysis. By post-processing the Newmark solutions, we derive a simple
   formulation for linearly varied third-order derivatives. By comparing
   the Newmark solutions with the exact solutions expanded in the Taylor
   series, we achieve the local post-processed solutions which are of
   fifth-order accuracy for displacements and fourth-order accuracy for
   velocities in one step. Based on the post-processing technique, a
   posteriori local error estimates for displacements, velocities and,
   thus, also the total energy norm error estimate are obtained. If the
   Newmark solutions are corrected at each step, the post-processed
   solutions are of third-order accuracy in the global sense, i.e.
   one-order improvement for the original Newmark solutions is achieved. We
   also discuss a method for estimating the global time integration error.
   We find that, when the total energy norm is used, the sum of the local
   error estimates will give a reasonable estimate for the global error. We
   present numerical studies on a SDOF and a 2-DOF example in order to
   demonstrate the performance of the proposed technique.},

   to problems in structural dynamics.  This method allows one to carry out
   analyses of undamped structures in the frequency domain, and yields
   highly accurate results for both discrete and continuous systems.  In
   essence, the solution involves:  (1) Finding both the transfer function
   and the forward Fourier transform of the excitation for complex
   frequencies; (2) performing a standard inverse Fourier transformation
   into the time domain; and (3) removing the effect of the complex
   frequencies by means of an exponential factor (or window).  Excellent
   results are obtained when this factor is chosen so that the power of the
   excitation and response signals at the end of the window are attenuated
   by some three orders of magnitude.  In such case, it is found that a
   quiet zone (a tail of trailing zeroes) is not needed for accurate
   computations, and that temporal aliasing (folding) is negligible.  This
   computational advantage is achieved at the expense of having to evaluate
   accurately the transfer functions at each frequency step, since
   interpolation schemes cannot be used in this method.}},

   for dynamic problems in structural mechanics. The theoretical foundation
   of the method is Hamilton's law of varying action. In contrast to
   traditional finite element approaches, where only the spatial domain is
   interpolated via shape functions, the present method interpolates both
   spatial and temporal domains. Following a review of the temporal finite
   element literature, the general theoretical development and formulative
   aspects of the current methodology are presented. To illustrate the
   proposed approach, a number of numerical examples are presented
   involving multiple degree-of-freedom (DOF) structural systems built from
   simple rod type elements that can exhibit linear, nonlinear elastic, or
   elasto-plastic (bilinear) material response. The time marching algorithm
   that results from this approach is conditionally stable with a time step
   limit comparable to that of other conventional schemes, exhibits no
   algorithmic damping, and gives good accuracy versus time step solutions.
   By using this rudimentary element, the fundamentals of the methodology
   are readily exposed, yet the approach is extendable to different element
   types such as beams and continual elements.},

  abstract                   = {{A high-order compact finite-difference scheme is applied and assessed
   for the numerical simulation of structural dynamics. The two-dimensional
   elastic stress-strain equations are considered in the generalized
   curvilinear coordinates and the spatial derivatives in the resulting
   equations are discretized by a fourth-order compact finite-difference
   scheme. For the time integration, an implicit second-order dual
   time-stepping method is utilized in which a fourth order Runge-Kutta
   scheme is used to integrate in the pseudo-time level. The accuracy and
   robustness of the solution procedure proposed are investigated through
   simulating different two-dimensional benchmark test cases in structural
   dynamics. A sensitivity study is also performed to examine the effect of
   the grid size on the accuracy and performance of the solution. The
   numerical results obtained by implementing the high-order compact
   finite-difference scheme are compared with the analytical solutions as
   well as the available numerical results which exhibit good agreement.
   The present work represents the first known implementation of the
   high-order compact finite-difference scheme in computational structural
   dynamics and that the solution methodology proposed is robust, accurate
   and efficient for such simulations. Note that the numerical solution
   procedure proposed to achieve high accurate results is simpler than the
   high-order finite-volume and finite-element formulations. The results
   obtained by applying the high-order compact finite-difference scheme can
   be considered as benchmark solutions for the assessment of the accuracy
   of other numerical methods applied for the simulation of structural
   dynamics problems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   new method is proposed in the present paper, in which an iterative
   scheme is involved. In each iterative step, an estimated solution is
   easily obtained firstly by solving a linear system of equations and the
   More accurate result is then searched around the estimated solution with
   high efficiency. The derivation is based on the principle of maximum
   entropy, in which an un-constrained optimization problem with fractional
   moments is involved. Three different methods for numerical integration
   of fractional moments are compared, which indicates that the bivariate
   dimension reduction method ensures the accuracy and efficiency
   simultaneously. Two examples, of which one deals with a linear random
   structure subjected to seismic excitation, the other deals with a
   nonlinear structure with random parameters subjected to random ground
   motions, are illustrated to validate the proposed method. The
   investigations show that the proposed method is of satisfactory accuracy

   structural dynamics very often exhibit high-frequency/low-frequency and
   linear/nonlinear behaviors of subsets of the state variables. With this
   in mind, the paper resorts to the use of different time integrators with
   differential time steps for subsystems, which tailors each method and
   its time step to the solution behaviors of the corresponding subsystem.
   In detail, a partitioned integration method is introduced which imposes
   continuity of velocities at the interface to couple arbitrary Newmark
   schemes with different time steps in different subdomains. It is proved
   that the velocity continuity of the method is the primal factor of its
   reduction to first-order accuracy. To maintain second-order accuracy
   without increasing drift and computational cost, a novel method with the
   acceleration continuity is proposed whose velocity constraint is also
   ensured by means of the projection strategy. Both its stability and
   accuracy properties are examined through numerical analysis of a
   Single-degree-of-freedom (DoF) split mass system. Finally, numerical
   validations are conducted on Single-and Two-DoF split mass systems and a
   four-DoF nonlinear structure showing the feasibility of the proposed

  abstract                   = {{This paper introduces and studies the class of differential variational
   inequalities (DVIs) in a finite-dimensional Euclidean space. The DVI
   provides a powerful modeling paradigm for many applied problems in which
   dynamics, inequalities, and discontinuities are present; examples of
   such problems include constrained time-dependent physical systems with
   unilateral constraints, differential Nash games, and hybrid engineering
   systems with variable structures. The DVI unifies several mathematical
   problem classes that include ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with
   smooth and discontinuous right-hand sides, differential algebraic
   equations (DAEs), dynamic complementarity systems, and evolutionary
   variational inequalities. Conditions are presented under which the DVI
   can be converted, either locally or globally, to an equivalent ODE with
   a Lipschitz continuous right-hand function. For DVIs that cannot be so
   converted, we consider their numerical resolution via an Euler
   time-stepping procedure, which involves the solution of a sequence of
   finite-dimensional variational inequalities. Borrowing results from
   differential inclusions (DIs) with upper semicontinuous, closed and
   convex valued multifunctions, we establish the convergence of such a
   procedure for solving initial-value DVIs. We also present a class of
   DVIs for which the theory of DIs is not directly applicable, and yet
   similar convergence can be established. Finally, we extend the method to
   a boundary-value DVI and provide conditions for the convergence of the
   method. The results in this paper pertain exclusively to systems with
   ``index{''} not exceeding two and which have absolutely continuous
   solutions.}},

   properties are of crucial importance in physical applications:
   preservation of energy, momentum, angular momentum, phase-space volume,
   symmetries, time-reversal symmetry, symplectic structure and dissipation
   are examples. In this paper we present a survey of geometric numerical
   integration methods for ordinary differential equations. Our aim has
   been to make-the review of use for both the novice and the more
   experienced practitioner interested in the new developments and
   directions of the past decade. To this end, the reader who is interested
   in reading up on detailed technicalities will be provided with numerous

   indeed can serve as an introduction to some of the ideas and methods of
   singular perturbation theory. Starting from Prandtl's work a large
   amount of work has been done in the area of singular perturbations. This
   paper limits its coverage to some standard singular perturbation models
   considered by various workers and the numerical methods developed by
   numerous researchers after 1984-2000. The work done in this area during
   the period 1905-1984 has already been surveyed by the first author of
   this paper, see {[}Appl. Math, Comput. 30 (1989) 223] for details. Due
   to the space constraints we have covered only singularly perturbed
   one-dimensional problems. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights

  abstract                   = {{The reader can find in the literature a lot of different techniques to
   study the dynamics of a given system and also, many suitable numerical
   integrators to compute them. Notwithstanding the recent work of
   {[}Maffione et al., 2011b] for mappings, a detailed comparison among the
   widespread indicators of chaos in a general system is still lacking.
   Such a comparison could lead to select the most efficient algorithms
   given a certain dynamical problem. Furthermore, in order to choose the
   appropriate numerical integrators to compute them, more comparative
   studies among numerical integrators are also needed.
   This work deals with both problems. We first extend the work of
   {[}Maffione et al., 2011b] for mappings to the 2D {[}Henon \& Heiles,
   1964] potential, and compare several variational indicators of chaos:
   the Lyapunov Indicator (LI); the Mean Exponential Growth Factor of
   Nearby Orbits (MEGNO); the Smaller Alignment Index (SALI) and its
   generalized version, the Generalized Alignment Index (GALI); the Fast
   Lyapunov Indicator (FLI) and its variant, the Orthogonal Fast Lyapunov
   Indicator (OFLI); the Spectral Distance (D) and the Dynamical Spectra of
   Stretching Numbers (SSNs). We also include in the record the Relative
   Lyapunov Indicator (RLI), which is not a variational indicator as the
   others. Then, we test a numerical technique to integrate Ordinary
   Differential Equations (ODEs) based on the Taylor method implemented by
   {[}Jorba \& Zou, 2005] (called taylor), and we compare its performance
   with other two well-known efficient integrators: the {[}Prince \&
   Dormand, 1981] implementation of a Runge-Kutta of order 7-8 (DOPRI8) and
   a Bulirsch-Stoer implementation. These tests are run under two very
   different systems from the complexity of their equations point of view:
   a triaxial galactic potential model and a perturbed 3D quartic
   oscillator.
   We first show that a combination of the FLI/OFLI, the MEGNO and the
   GALI(2N) succeeds in describing in detail most of the dynamical
   characteristics of a general Hamiltonian system. In the second part, we
   show that the precision of taylor is better than that of the other
   integrators tested, but it is not well suited to integrate systems of
   equations which include the variational ones, like in the computing of
   almost all the preceeding indicators of chaos. The result which induces
   us to draw this conclusion is that the computing times spent by taylor
   are far greater than the times consumed by the DOPRI8 and the
   Bulirsch-Stoer integrators in such cases. On the other hand, the package
   is very efficient when we only need to integrate the equations of motion
   (both in precision and speed), for instance to study the chaotic
   diffusion. We also notice that taylor attains a greater precision on the
   coordinates than either the DOPRI8 or the Bulirsch-Stoer.}},

  abstract                   = {{In this work we review single step methods of the Runge-Kutta type with
   special properties. Among them are methods specially tuned to integrate
   problems that exhibit a pronounced oscillatory character and such
   problems arise often in celestial mechanics and quantum mechanics.
   Symplectic methods, exponentially and trigonometrically fitted methods,
   minimum phase-lag and phase-fitted methods are presented. These are
   Runge-Kutta, Runge-Kutta-Nystrom and Partitioned Runge-Kutta methods.
   The theory of constructing such methods is given as well as several
   specific methods. In order to present the performance of the methods we
   have tested 58 methods from all categories. We consider the two
   dimensional harmonic oscillator, the two body problem, the pendulum
   problem and the orbital problem studied by Stiefel and Bettis. Also we
   have tested the methods on the computation of the eigenvalues of the one
   dimensional time independent Schrodinger equation with the harmonic
   oscillator, the doubly anharmonic oscillator and the exponential
   potentials. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

  abstract                   = {{We developed multi-step iterative method for computing the numerical
   solution of nonlinear systems, associated with ordinary differential
   equations (ODEs) of the form L(x(t)) + f(x(t)) = g(t) : here L(.) is a
   linear differential operator and f(.) is a nonlinear smooth function.
   The proposed iterative scheme only requires one inversion of Jacobian
   which is computationally very efficient if either LU-decomposition or
   GMRES-type methods are employed. The higher-order Frechet derivatives of
   the nonlinear system stemming from the considered ODEs are diagonal
   matrices. We used the higher-order Frechet derivatives to enhance the
   convergence-order of the iterative schemes proposed in this note and
   indeed the use of a multi-step method dramatically increases the
   convergence-order. The second-order Frechet derivative is used in the
   first step of an iterative technique which produced third-order
   convergence. In a second step we constructed matrix polynomial to
   enhance the convergence-order by three. Finally, we freeze the product
   of a matrix polynomial by the Jacobian inverse to generate the
   multi-step method. Each additional step will increase the

  abstract                   = {An overview of recent advances in computational dynamics for modeling
   and simulation is described. The targeted objectives are towards a wide
   variety of science and engineering applications in particle and
   continuum dynamics of structures and materials which fall in this class.
   Starting with the supposition that in the beginning, the well known
   Newton's law of motion for N-body systems is given, and is a statement
   of the principle of balance of linear momentum, subsequently, using this
   as a landmark, firstly, the principal relations to various other
   distinctly different fundamental principles which are of primary
   interest here are established. Likewise, for continuum dynamics of
   structures, via the principle of balance of linear momentum, analogous
   developments are also established. Consequently, these distinctly
   different fundamental principles are shown to serve as the starting
   point for the various developments. Stemming from three distinctly
   different fundamental principles, we present recent advances in N-body
   dynamical systems, and also continuous-body dynamical systems with focus
   on numerical aspects in space/time discretization. The fundamental
   principles are the following: the Principle of Virtual Work in Dynamics,
   Hamilton's Principle and as an alternate (due to inconsistencies
   associated with Hamilton's principle), Hamilton's Law of Varying Action,
   and the Principle of Balance of Mechanical Energy. Both vector and
   scalar formalisms are described in detail with particular focus towards
   general numerical discretizations in space and/or time for N-body and
   continuum-elastodynamics applications which are encountered in a wide
   class of holonomic-scleronomic problems. The formulations include the
   classical Newtonian mechanics framework with vector formalism, and new
   scalar formalisms with descriptive functions such as the Lagrangian, the
   Hamiltonian, and the Total Mechanical Energy to readily enable numerical
   discretizations. The concepts emanating from the present developments
   and distinctly different fundamental principles inherently: (1) can
   independently be shown to yield the strong form of the governing
   mathematical model equations of motion that are continuous in space
   and/or time together with the natural boundary conditions; the various
   frameworks for the case of holonomic-scleronomic systems with the
   mentioned limitations are indeed all equivalent, (2) can explain
   naturally how the weak statement of the Bubnov-Galerkin
   weighted-residual form that is customarily employed for discretization
   with vector formalism arises for both space and time, and (3) can
   circumvent relying upon traditional practices of conducting numerical
   discretizations starting either from balance of linear momentum
   (Newton's second law) involving Cauchy's equations of motion (governing
   equations) arising from continuum mechanics or via (1) and (2) above if
   one chooses this option. The concepts instead provide new avenues for
   numerical space/time discretization for continuum-dynamical systems or
   time discretization for N-body systems, and consequently, they enable
   equivalences to be drawn from amongst the various frameworks under
   certain restrictions to provide a unified approach and viewpoint. In
   addition, for the time discretization, focusing attention upon the class
   of Linear Multi Step (LMS) methods which are the most popular in
   research and commercial software, we particularly describe from a
   unified viewpoint, new avenues of discretization of the equations of
   motion via a new Total Energy framework.
   The resulting developments lead to improved phyical insight, inherit
   computationally attractive features for developing algorithms by design,
   and new and optimal algorithm designs, while recovering most of the
   developments that currently exist from traditional and/or classical
   practices.},

  abstract                   = {{Lyapunov functions are an essential tool in the stability analysis of
   dynamical systems, both in theory and applications. They provide
   sufficient conditions for the stability of equilibria or more general
   invariant sets, as well as for their basin of attraction. The necessity,
   i.e. the existence of Lyapunov functions, has been studied in converse
   theorems, however, they do not provide a general method to compute them.
   Because of their importance in stability analysis, numerous
   computational construction methods have been developed within the
   Engineering, Informatics, and Mathematics community. They cover
   different types of systems such as ordinary differential equations,
   switched systems, non-smooth systems, discrete-time systems etc., and
   employ different methods such as series expansion, linear programming,
   linear matrix inequalities, collocation methods, algebraic methods,
   set-theoretic methods, and many others. This review brings these
   different methods together. First, the different types of systems, where
   Lyapunov functions are used, are briefly discussed. In the main part,
   the computational methods are presented, ordered by the type of method
   used to construct a Lyapunov function.}},

   illustration, our approach is applied to the well-known RK8(7) pair of
   Prince and Dormand {[}10], and its speedup and efficiency examined.

  abstract = {This article is a tutorial exposition of the template approach to the construction of customized mass-stiffness pairs for selected applications in structural dynamics. The main focus is on adjusting the mass matrix. Two well known discretization methods, described in FEM textbooks since the late 1960s, lead to diagonally lumped and consistent mass matrices, respectively. Those models are sufficient to cover many engineering applications but for some problems they fall short. The gap can be filled with a more general approach that relies on the use of templates. These are algebraic forms that carry free parameters. Templates have the virtue of producing a set of mass matrices that satisfy certain a priori constraint conditions such as symmetry, nonnegativity, invariance and momentum conservation. In particular, the diagonally lumped and consistent versions can be obtained as instances. Availability of free parameters, however, allows the mass matrix to be customized to special needs, such as high precision vibration frequencies or minimally dispersive wave propagation. An attractive feature of templates for FEM programming is that only one element implementation as module with free parameters is needed, and need not be recoded when the application problem class changes. The paper provides a general overview of the topic, and illustrates it with one-dimensional structural elements: bars and beams.},

Other explicit methods, viz. Runge-Kutta methods, stiffly stable methods, Predictor-Corrector methods and Taylor series schemes are also presented. Techniques for stabilizing numerical computations are given. In Part II, conventional implicit methods, viz. the Newmark, Wilson-θ and Houbolt methods and their step-by-step solution procedures are given with reference to solution of linear and nonlinear structural dynamics problems. Also presented are Trujillo's modified Newmark-beta method and implicit formulae via weighted residual approach. Computational and stability aspects, desirable characteristics of an ideal solution procedure and salient features of conventional implicit algorithms are discussed. Part \{III\} reviews further developments in implicit methods. In Part IV, mixed implicit-explicit finite element methods and operator-splitting methods are described.

  abstract = {Implicit Newmark schemes for integration of finite rotations in structural and continuum mechanics typically are more complicated than those used for translational motion. Using Euler’s representation of the rotation tensor Λ in terms of a rotation vector ϕ , numerical integration connecting the values { ϕ n , Λ n } and { ϕ n + 1 , Λ n + 1 } at the beginning and end of the time step is expressed in terms of an incremental rotation vector θ and the associated incremental rotation tensor Λ ( θ ) . Here, it is shown using backward differentiation that neglecting third order terms in θ , the approximation for the angular velocity ω in terms of θ and its time derivative has the same form as that between velocity and displacement. Consequently, the simplified Newmark scheme in terms of { θ , ω , ω ̇ } has the same form as that for updating translations. Details of the Newmark scheme and an analytical expression for the tangent stiffness tensor for the associated Newton–Raphson iteration procedure have been presented for rigid body dynamics. The resulting integration scheme has been tested on a nontrivial problem of three-dimensional motion of a rigid body using a constant time step. The results justify the use of the simplified Newmark scheme for finite rotations. },

Convergence and stability analysis is given and verifies that the \{DAE\} α-methods introduce no additional oscillations and preserve the stability of the underlying \{ODE\} system. Convergence of the Newton iteration, which can be a source of difficulty in solving nonlinear oscillatory systems with large stepsizes, is achieved via a coordinate-split modification to the Newton iteration.

  abstract = {A method of deriving parallel algorithms from well-established conventional direct integration algorithms such as the Wilson θ method, Newmark β method etc. is presented. The new algorithms are able to effectively exploit the power of parallel computers for the dynamic analysis of large-scale structures, and may be more efficient than the conventional methods, even on uniprocessors. It appears that the parallel algorithms can be made to maintain the property of unconditional stability displayed by the conventional methods. The parallel algorithms are derived by splitting the stiffness, damping and mass matrices such that the dynamic equations of motion can be cast in block diagonal form. The splitting of the matrices corresponds to physical subdomains of the structure. Each set of block diagonal equations can be solved independently of the others and therefore the computations can be performed in parallel. However, a predictor-corrector approach requiring iterations within a time step must be used for acceptable accuracy. The method described in this paper is derived from the Wilson θ method and is called the “parallel Wilson θ method.” A simple numerical example is used to illustrate the accuracy of the parallel method, which is comparable to the conventional method when a sufficient number of iterations is used. Preliminary computations were performed on a \{BBN\} GP-1000 distributed-memory parallel computer to assess the performance of the parallel algorithm. The proposed method is especially suited for large-scale non-linear structural dynamics problems. },

Using established techniques developed by J. von Neumann and Lax and Richtmyer, the latter two approximation operators are found to be unconditionally stable. In addition, the constant average acceleration version of the Newmark method is found to be unconditionally stable and to possess no attenuation due to approximation viscosity. Truncation error due to the low-pass filtering characteristics of spatially discretized systems is highly damped by the Wilson averaging and Gurtin averaging operators; all three operators exhibit error in the period of the response which is a function of time step size. },

The proposed algorithm is formulated in terms of two Hermitian finite difference operators of fifth-order local truncation error and it is unconditionally stable with no numerical damping presenting a fourth-order truncation error for period dispersion (global error).

  abstract = {A numerical integration procedure for rotational motion using a rotation vector parametrization is explored from an engineering perspective by using rudimentary vector analysis. The incremental rotation vector, angular velocity and acceleration correspond to different tangent spaces of the rotation manifold at different times and have a non-vectorial character. We rewrite the equation of motion in terms of vectors lying in the same tangent space, facilitating vector space operations consistent with the underlying geometric structure. While any integration algorithm (that works within a vector space setting) may be used, we presently employ a family of explicit Runge–Kutta algorithms to solve this equation. While this work is primarily motivated out of a need for highly accurate numerical solutions of dissipative rotational systems of engineering interest, we also compare the numerical performance of the present scheme with some of the invariant preserving schemes, namely ALGO-C1, STW, LIEMID[EA] and SUBCYC-M. Numerical results show better local accuracy via the present approach vis-á-vis the preserving algorithms. It is also noted that the preserving algorithms do not simultaneously preserve all constants of motion. We incorporate adaptive time-stepping within the present scheme and this in turn enables still higher accuracy and a ‘near preservation’ of constants of motion over significantly longer intervals. },

Special attention was paid to \{RKMs\} which are optimal, in that the corresponding stepsize conditions are as little restrictive as possible within a given class of methods. Extensive searches for such optimal methods were made in classes of explicit RKMs, see e.g. Gottlieb and Shu [S. Gottlieb, C.-W. Shu, Math. Comp. 67 (1998) 73–85], Spiteri and Ruuth [R.J.

Some methods, with 1 ⩽ p ⩽ 4 , are proved to be optimal, whereas others are obtained by a numerical search. We present closed-form expressions for two families of \{SDIRK\} methods (with s ⩾ 3 ) which we conjecture to be optimal for p = 2 and p = 3 , respectively. Furthermore we prove, for strongly stable \{SDIRK\} methods, the order barrier p ⩽ 4 . We perform numerical experiments, to compare the theoretical properties of various optimal \{SDIRK\} methods to the actual \{TVD\} properties in the solution of a nonlinear test equation, the 1-dimensional Buckley–Leverett equation. },

It is found that the central difference method exhibits stability characteristics for relatively large time steps in both linear and non-linear problems. For the non-linear and vibratory examples considered in this article, it appears that the Newmark-beta and Runge-Kutta methods are unstable even with a small time step.

This physical characteristic may be exploited by making use of substructure concepts in the dynamic response analysis. The elastic components may be represented by a small matrix of stiffness coefficients coupling them to the nonlinear elements, and only the properties of the few nonlinear elements need be modified during the response analysis. Both direct and indirect techniques for taking advantage of localized nonlinearity are reviewed here. In the direct methods the equations of motion are integrated by step-by-step procedures. Various methods of reducing the effective number of degrees of freedom are discussed. In the indirect methods the response to simple loadings is determined, and the response to the prescribed loading is obtained by superposition. A technique for applying superposition to the linear portion of the structure while treating the nonlinear region by a step-by-step procedure is described. },

Instead of attacking the problem in the nonlinear differential manifold SO(3) (pure rotational dynamics), as is usually done, we derive equations for the complete problem of motion (translational and rotational dynamics) on an extended manifold. We develop a generalization of Runge-Kutta methods that, by design, ensures that the solution will remain on the manifold for any choice of the tableau. This is obtained through configuration updates performed via the exponential map. We show how certain terms can be approximated, while retaining the order of accuracy of the scheme, and how the method conserves the total momentum of the system. Within this framework, we develop two nonlinearly unconditionally stable time integration schemes, that are associated with discrete laws of conservation/dissipation of the total energy. The dissipating algorithm generalizes to the nonlinear case the high frequency damping characteristics provided by some well-known conventional methods. We present numerical results to support our analysis, and we develop a complete application of this methodology to the nonlinear dynamics of three-dimensional rods undergoing large displacements and finite rotations, under the assumption of small strains. },

  abstract = {The paper discusses adaptive procedures for elastodynamic problems using semi-discrete finite elements. The adaptivity in space may be done by mesh refinement (h-version), by increase of order of the approximation polynomials (p-version) or a combination of these (hp-version). In time, the integration is either made by mode superposition of characteristic functions or by direct integration. The adaptation in time may either be made by change of the global time-step (h-version) or increase of the order of approximation polynomials (p-version). Crucial parts of the analysis are the error estimator and the error indicator, which are based either on interpolation theory or on total energy obtained from postprocessed stresses. For the mesh generation and regeneration, an isoline technique is utilized by which the mesh can be smoothed by interpolation theory. The isolines are created for some characteristic scalar function. For time discretization, a new simple a posteriori local error estimator for the Newmark scheme is described. It is derived by a post-processing technique without solving new equations so the additional computational cost is small and the implementation is convenient. The paper also describes a sequence of nested time-integration methods for dynamic problems formulated as two first order equations in time. These nested integration methods in time based on a hierarchical formulation in time are A-stable schemes of order 2k and L-stable schemes of order 2k − 1. A considerable improvement in terms of accuracy as well as effectiveness is obtained, compared to currently available methods. },

The weight parameters θ are found through a simple formula for a range of values r. These are used to integrate three numerical formulations of the non-linear dynamics equation for a planar pendulum. Comparisons with existing integration methods show that, for r non-positive, the r-methods are accurate, stable and very competitive. Results are dependent both upon r and the formulation.

Because the mechanical dispersion effect is far larger than the molecular diffusion, the notorious spurious oscillations can be controlled by limiting the ratio of grid size to the streamline mixing length. The method is demonstrated on an example of a typical aquifer by giving the diagnostic variation of concentration and various salt profiles for different values of the key parameter.},

  abstract  = {The long-term dynamic response of non-linear geometrically exact rods under-going finite extension, shear and bending, accompanied by large overall motions, is addressed in detail. The central objective is the design of unconditionally stable time-stepping algorithms which exactly preserve fundamental constants of the motion such as the total linear momentum, the total angular momentum and, for the Hamiltonian case, the total energy. This objective is accomplished in two steps. First, a class of algorithms is introduced which conserves linear and angular momentum. This result holds independently of the definition of the algorithmic stress resultants. Second, an algorithmic counterpart of the elastic constitutive equations is developed such that the law of conservation of total energy is exactly preserved. Conventional schemes exhibiting no numerical dissipation, symplectic algorithms in particular, are shown to lead to unstable solutions when the high frequencies are not resolved. Compared to conventional schemes there is little, if any, additional computational cost involved in the proposed class of energy–momentum methods. The excellent performance of the new algorithm in comparison to other standard schemes is demonstrated in several numerical simulations.},

A technique to clustering the mesh around the interface is used to improved the modelling, and a boundary condition based on the relative mobilities of the two fiuids is imposed to enable the program to calculate the water-oil ratio after breakthrough. The effect of lumping the mass matrix is then examined with a view to reducting the surge in the values obtained for the capillary pressure.

Some unusual modes of behaviour, which are of substantial interest, have been observed. In the first case, a stable but chaotic solution is found. In the second case, while a stable solution is obtained with a certain time step, an unstable solution is found by decreasing the time step. In the third case, instability is triggered by neglecting the initial acceleration. A simple modification of the Newmark scheme is proposed which keeps the energy constant for the equation ü + P(u) = 0 and thereby guarantees unconditional stability. Numerical examples in support of such an energy-conserving scheme are presented.},

  abstract  = {A new finite element algorithm for solving elastic and elastoplastic coupled consolidation problems is described. The procedure treats the governing consolidation relations as a system of first-order differential equations and is based on the backward Euler and Thomas and Gladwell schemes with automatic subincrementation of a prescribed series of time increments. The prescribed time increments, which are called coarse time steps, serve to start the procedure and are chosen by the user. The automatic consolidation algorithm attempts to select the time subincrements such that, for a given mesh, the time-stepping (or temporal discretisation) error in the displacements lies close to a specified tolerance.Unlike existing solution techniques, the new algorithm computes not only the displacements and pore pressures, but also their derivatives with respect to time. These extra variables permit a family of unconditionally stable integration algorithms to be constructed which automatically provide an estimate of the local truncation error for each time step. This error estimate is inexpensive to compute and may be used to develop a simple and efficient automatic time stepping mechanism. For the elastic case, the displacements and pore pressures at the end of each subincrement may be solved directly without the need for iteration. For elastoplastic behaviour, however, the governing relationships are non-linear and a system of non-linear equations must be solved to compute the updates. Copyright © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

There is very little difference in run times and rate of convergence of the iteration.

As a consequence, the evolution including the clear distinction and the bridging of the relationships between time operators termed as integral operators to the so-called integration operators in time are theoretically developed and demonstrated. The present developments seem to not only provide avenues leading to new algorithms for transient analysis but also provide generalizations and framework to recover a wide variety of existing algorithms. Consequently, under the umbrella of the present framework, a variety of plausible new approaches for generating Nth-order accurate time discretization operators from approximations introduced to Type 1 integral operators in time are first described followed by the developments systematically leading to Type 2 time discretization operators, and subsequently to a wide class of Type 3 time integration operators including the recovery of a variety of known existing time integration operators which can be uniquely identified by Discrete Numerically Assigned (DNA) algorithmic markers. Of the various developments, of noteworthy mention and emphasis here are a new family of L-stable Nth-order Integration Operators (LNInO) of Type 2 for transient computations. Subsequently, some practically useful second-order forms are specifically illustrated and highlighted. The stability and accuracy characteristics are also described for a variety of generated algorithms applicable for transient heat transfer computations. Although the primary focus is on the theoretical developments encompassing linear operators, some simple numerical examples are finally demonstrated to merely illustrate the salient features of the proposed developments.

The algorithm is presented as an extension of the generalized Newmark scheme. It seems to retain the asymptotic features of the original one.The reduction of the number of dynamic degrees of freedom of the unilaterally constrained structures is carried out by representing the equations of motion in modal co-ordinates of the unconstrained structure and truncating the dynamic contributions of higher modes.The presented techniques have been verified by investigating free longitudinal vibroimpact motion laws of an elastic vibroconverter and free longitudinal and bending vibration of a vibroconverter interacting with a moving rigid body by oblique impact and friction forces.},

  abstract      = {In this paper, various least-squares procedures to solve first-order initial value problems are studied. The accuracy and stability properties are investigated by applying the methods to a linear first-order ordinary differential equation. In relating the least-squares procedures to the weighted residual method, the weighting functions can be identified as the residuals obtained by substituting the trial functions into the governing equation. By using a different set of functions to construct the residual weighting functions, a more general ‘pseudo’-least-squares method is proposed here. Instead of having the weighting functions specified explicitly and the characteristics of the resultant algorithms investigated, the weighting parameter method is adopted. The required residual weighting functions can be reconstructed from the selected weighting parameters. The weighting parameters corresponding to the A-stable generalized Padé approximations are presented in this paper. The order of accuracy is 4n−1 in general if n unknown variables are used in approximating the solutions. It is found that a direct application of the least-squares procedures to multi-degree-of-freedom systems may result in loss of accuracy. By studying the uncoupling conditions for the multi-degree-of-freedom systems, modified forms are suggested for various least-squares methods to maintain the accuracy and stability properties. A two-degree-of-freedom system is used to illustrate the accuracy of the standard, pseudo- and modified-least-squares procedures. Copyright © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

The time-step estimates were determined for three finite element, and three finite difference schemes. Comparisons between finite element and finite difference methods and the various time-stepping schemes were conducted. The dynamic time-step estimates are functions of grid size and the smallest eigenvalue of the system of ODEs, λ1. The results indicate that the finite element and finite difference methods generate similar time-step estimates and are at similar accuracy levels. The central difference scheme is superior to the other two schemes as far as the flexibility in allowing larger time step while maintaining the accuracy. The backward difference and the forward difference schemes were very close in their level of accuracy. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

This approach is based on the assumption that the effect of a non-linear restoring force is equivalent to a series of impulse functions acting on the so called fundamental linear system. Applying this basic idea with unconditionally stable step-by-step integration methods, the non-linear dynamic analysis of structures can be executed by a linear one-step direct integration procedure by modifying the velocity and acceleration at the end of the time step (post-correction) instead of modifying the structural properties at the beginning of each time step. A general description of the proposed post-correction approach for the direct integration of the equations of motion is presented. The algorithm to combine the proposed approach with the unconditionally stable Wilson θ method is discussed in great detail. Numerical results are included to verify the accuracy of the method and to illustrate the computing procedure.},

  abstract   = {The application of spline functions in the analysis of structural dynamics is presented in this paper. The nodal points in time discretization for determining the spline curve can be separated into two classes: the p nodal points before the current time (including current time) and the q nodal points after the current time. On the p nodal points, the structural responses were calculated at previous time steps. The q nodal points represent the unknown structural response at future time steps which should meet the requirement of dynamic equilibrium. By a trial and error procedure, at least 16 families of spline curves with different locations of p and q nodal points can be found to meet the requirements of unconditional stability. The accuracy of each family is dependent on the order of the spline and the locations of the nodal points. The 16 families of spline curves supply a wide range of accuracy that can be selected easily. It can be shown that the well-known Wilson-method and the Houbolt method are special cases of the present spline approximations.},

  abstract  = {In Parts I to V of the present work, the formulation and finite element implementation of a non-linear stress resultant shell model are considered in detail. This paper is concerned with the extension of these results to incorporate completely general non-linear dynamic response. Of special interest here is the dynamics of very flexible shells undergoing large overall motion which conserves the total linear and angular momentum and, for the Hamiltonian case, the total energy. A main goal of this paper is the design of non-linear time-stepping algorithms, and the construction of finite element interpolations, which preserve exactly these fundamental constants of motion. It is shown that only a very special class of algorithms, namely a formulation of the mid-point rule in conservation form, exactly preserves the total linear and angular momentum. For the Hamiltonian case, a somewhat surprising result is proved: regardless of the degree of non-linearity in the stored-energy function, a generalized mid-point rule algorithm always exists which exactly conserves energy The conservation properties of a time-stepping algorithm need not, and in general will not, be preserved by the spatial discretization. Precise conditions which ensure preservation of these conservation properties are derived. A number of numerical simulations are presented which illustrate the exact conservation properties of the proposed methodology.},

Because such activities are expensive, the number of experimental units (communities) is usually very small. Investigators often match communities on demographic variables in order to improve the power of their studies. Matching is known to improve power in certain circumstances. However, we show here that if the number of communities is small, the matched design will probably have less power than the unmatched design. This is due primarily to the loss of degrees of freedom in the matched design, which outweighs the benefits of matching on any but the strongest correlates of changes in behaviour. In the community intervention situation, even small differences in sample size between the matched and unmatched analyses can have expensive consequences.},

The specific aim of this study was to compare the effects of two walking frequencies, holding intensity and duration constant, on blood lipids, body composition, and exercise maintenance regimens of Mexican American women. A quasi-experimental design, with two treatment groups and one comparison group, was used to explore the dose-response effects of low-intensity exercise on cardiovascular outcomes.

LDL-cholesterol (LDLC) in the post-menopausal women (Post-T: 96 ±32 mg dl-1; Post-UT: 104 ±23 mg dl-1) tended to be higher than in the premenopausal women (Pre-T: 86 ± 25 mg dl-1, Pre-UT: 81 ± 23 mg dl-1). LDLC/HDLC ratio in Post-UT (1·42 ±0·38 unit) was higher than in the pre-menopausal women (Pre-T: 1·03±0·31 unit, P<0·01; Pre-UT: 1·10±0·38 unit, P<0·05), whereas the ratio in Post-T (1·20 ±0·38 unit) was not different from those of the pre-menopausal groups. These results suggest that endurance running protects against the increase in LDLC/HDLC ratio that frequently occurs after menopause.},

  abstract  = {Six patients with cutaneous melanoma were treated with intratumoral Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG). Four showed good responses with regression of injected and, frequently, of uninjected lesions, whereas two developed dissemination and died. Three of four responders remain in complete remission. Two straìns of BCG were used; there was no detectable difference in therapeutic efficacy. Three of four responders showed a significant increase in lymphocyte stimulation (LS) to melanoma antigens, and all responders showed a marked increase in phytohemagglutinin (PHA). Non-responders showed no increase to either stimulant. All responders were negative for leukocyte migration inhibition (LMI) to melanoma antigens before BCG, but two of four responders converted to positive after BCG therapy. Of the non-responders, one was positive and one was negative before therapy; there was no change following BCG. There was a marked increase in active rosette-forming cells (RFCS) in all responders and in only one of two non-responders. Preliminary studies suggest that BCG also affects the level of circulating inhibitors which abrogate the activity of immune lymphocytes to melanoma antigens. A definite sequence occurs following intratumoral BCG: (1) disruption of melanogenesis with release of pigment from tumor cells (3-6 h); (2) inflammatory response of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNS) and mononuclear cells which remain at the tumor periphery (6-24h); (3) tumor-cell death (24h); and (4) granulomas replacing tumor (2 weeks). The response to BCG resembles the immunologic and histopathologic changes observed in halo nevi. These studies suggest that BCG activates both tumor-specific and non-specific immune responses. Thus, in vitro parameters of cell-mediated immunity (CMI) are affected by BCG and some, particularly LS, LMI and the active rosette test, seem to correlate with clinical response.},

In the present study we investigated prospectively the effect of a moderate physical conditioning programme on plasma lipids and lipoproteins, especially HDL-cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I), the major apoprotein of HDL. Healthy, sedentary, middle-aged men were randomly selected and assigned either to a training group (n= 24, age 40±3–4, mean ± SD) or to a control group (n= 13, age 39±50). Training consisted of various indoor and outdoor sports activities 45 min/day, 3 times/week for 12 weeks at an intensity of approximately 80% of measured maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max). The trained subjects were studied at 4, 8 and 12 weeks. The training increased VO2 max by 12% (P < 0–01). Increases were observed in both apo A-I (10%, P < 0 02) and HDL-cholesterol (8%, P < 002) after training, with significant increases already after 4 and 8 weeks, respectively. Furthermore, decreases in total plasma cholesterol (5%, P < 0004) and plasma triglycerides (26%, P < 0 003) were found without changes in body weight, body composition, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption or the percentage composition of dietary intake. Fasting serum-insulin concentrations decreased significantly during training. No changes were noted in the control group. The present study demonstrates prospectively that moderate physical training can increase HDL.},

Because such interventions are expensive, the number of experimental units (communities) is usually small. Because of the small number of communities involved, investigators often match treatment and control communities on demographic variables before randomization to minimize the possibility of a bad split. Unfortunately, matching has been shown to decrease the power of the design when the number of pairs is small, unless the matching variable is very highly correlated with the outcome variable (in this case, with change in the health behaviour). We used computer simulation to examine the performance of an approach in which we matched communities but performed an unmatched analysis. If the appropriate matching variables are unknown, and there are fewer than ten pairs, an unmatched design and analysis has the most power. If, however, one prefers a matched design, then for N > 10, power can be increased by performing an unmatched analysis of the matched data. We also discuss a variant of this procedure, in which an unmatched analysis is performed only if the matching ‘did not work’.},

The model was then examined with longitudinal data. Confirmatory and longitudinal analyses showed an excellent tit between the model and the data. Results indicated that the costs and benefits of exercise and self-efficacy for exercise were related to physical activity only indirectly, through the mediation of stage of readiness to exercise. Structural modeling fit indices revealed that much of the variation and covariation in physical activity was explained by the model. There is the potential to enhance the impact of exercise interventions, by targeting them so as to address factors related to these different stages of readiness.},

  abstract = {In this study we investigate the long term evolutionary trend of tidal marshes and their possible tendency to approach equilibrium. We account of the dynamic interaction between the marsh and its adjacent environment, allowing for both variations of marsh elevation and displacement of the marsh boundary. We thus consider a 1-D configuration consisting of a tidal channel merging into a 1-D marsh. Starting from some initial configuration of the channel we model how a salt marsh forms at the landward end of the channel and determine the long term evolution of the channel - marsh configuration under different scenarios of relative sea level rise. Previously established results on the morphodynamic evolution of a tidal channel are extended accounting for the effects of vegetation and wind driven sediment resuspension in regions where tidal stresses are too weak to mobilize sediments. Results suggest that, for sufficiently low rates of relative sea level rise the marsh platform may be able to reach an equilibrium elevation, provided wind resuspension is able to maintain a sufficiently large sediment concentration close to the marsh boundary. This is in general agreement with recent results based on zero dimensional modeling. However, we find that the marsh boundary is unstable, as progradation or retreat is generally experienced depending on a delicate balance between tidal transport and transport driven by wind setup. In this sense, actual morphodynamic equilibrium is a rather exceptional and unstable state.},

These long-period waves are a response of the sea surface to forcing by a nonmonochromatic, wind-generated surface wave field. The synthetic aperture radar data were successfully compared with an in situ wave gauge record. Both one- and two-dimensional fast Fourier transforms were generated from near and offshore regions of synthetic aperture radar data. The synthetic aperture radar-derived near and offshore spectral estimates exhibited both low- and high-frequency wave components. Classical bathymetrically controlled wave refraction was observed for both the short as well as long wave components of the sea surface. This paper demonstrates the ability of X band synthetic aperture radar to detect low-amplitude, long-period signals. The signals appear to correspond to a ‘surf beat’ generated by the incident wind wave field.},

The solution would give, for example, the rate of flow of water through the dam, the extent of the surface of seepage on the downstream side of the dam, and the shape and position of the water table within the dam. The method, which is presented for the no-tailwater case, applies to a dam with perpendicular upstream and downstream walls. It is based on the fact that the hodograph of such a dam consists simply of a triangle, plus an internal circular arc cut that represents the water table. A key step in the method is possible because, in the plane generated by the first Schwarz-Christoffel transformation, the curve corresponding to the water table approaches a parabola near the point at infinity.},

Fishers (Pekania pennanti) in the west coast states of Washington, Oregon, and California, USA have not recovered from population declines and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed options for listing them as threatened. Our objectives were to evaluate differences in survival and mortality risk from natural (e.g., predation, disease, injuries, starvation) and human-linked causes (e.g., rodenticide exposure [toxicants], vehicle strikes). We monitored survival of 232 radio-collared fishers at a northern and southern study site in the Sierra National Forest, California. We retrieved fisher carcasses, and used necropsy examinations to determine causes of death. We estimated survival and mortality rates using the Kaplan–Meier estimator and nonparametric cumulative incidence functions, respectively, and integrated risk-specific survival rates into a Leslie matrix to evaluate how population growth (λ) might improve if management can reduce mortality from any of the risks. We determined cause of death for 93 of 121 fishers, and annual survival was 0.69 for all fishers, and 0.72 for female fishers. Mortality rates were 19.5% for predation; 2.5% for disease, injury, and starvation; and 1.9% for toxicant exposure and vehicle strikes. Predation rates were similar between sexes, and relative risk was 51% lower in fall and winter compared to spring and summer. Combined mortality from disease, injuries, starvation, vehicle strikes, and toxicants was 4.4%, and 11 times higher for males than females. We estimated a base λ at the northern site of 0.96, which had the potential to increase to 1.03 or 1.11 if predation were reduced by 25% or 50%, respectively, whereas λ could increase to 0.97 in the absence of deaths from all other risks except predation. Predation was the dominant limiting factor in our study population, and was also the most common mortality risk for fishers in the 3 West Coast states (67%), followed by disease, injury, and starvation (12%) and vehicle strikes (8%). Direct mortality from toxicants appeared limited to fishers in California. Our results identified the need for continued and potential expanded restrictions on habitat disturbance in fisher denning habitats. Research is needed on contact rates between larger predators and fishers, including whether fishers are more vulnerable to attack in open forests or along roads used by coursing predators. © 2015 The Wildlife Society.

In the ‘block iterative step’, the preprocessed information is retrieved from permanent storage and the matrix equation is assembled and solved in an efficient manner according to a generalization of the block successive over-relaxation iterative method. Significant advantages over common finite element simulation techniques are achieved in terms of both computer core requirements and execution time.

  abstract = {The NCAR regional climate model RegCM is coupled to the WAM ocean model, using the sea-state-dependent roughness parameterization derived in the HEXOS experiment. Coupled model simulations are shown to give reduced wind speeds U10 compared to uncoupled simulations. This is in accord with other recent studies. However, the wave-atmosphere coupling is effected through the friction velocity field u*, rather than through the wind field U10. Thus because the coupling gives enhanced resistive friction, U10 is weakened, whereas u* is enhanced. Wave heights, driven by u*, are also increased in our coupled model simulations compared to uncoupled model simulations. Coupled model outputs are shown to compare favorably with air-sea observations collected during the recent Labrador Sea Deep Convection Experiment in 1997, both for synoptic storm timescales and for seasonal timescales.},

Two of the three schemes obtained using a quadratic interpolation equation and quadratic weighting functions are also shown to be unconditionally unstable. The third scheme is unconditionally stable, but the calculated values for a numerical solution of u̇ + u = 0, u(0) = 1 are not as accurate as the values obtained using the single-step central difference method.},

The counts continued to increase for the next 3–4 days and then there was a slight decrease. A second increase followed and the leucocyte and neutrophil counts increased to 52.84 × 109/1 and 45.16 × 109/1 on the day after the last rcG-CSF administration (Day 15). The counts decreased rapidly immediately after the administration of rcG-CSF was stopped and then at a slower rate. The cell counts were still higher than in the controls at the end of the study period (Day 35). Bone marrow cellularity increased from 10–25% before rcG-CSF was given to 60–80% after 5 days. The increase in cellularity was due to increased myeloid activity because the myeloid to erythroid ratio increased from 2.7 to 8.8. Serum chemistry changes were minimal although foals given rcG-CSF at various times had lower glucose concentrations and increased alkaline phosphatase and gamma glutamyl transferase activities.},

Immunosuppressed organ homograft recipients have a 5–6% risk of the development of de novo cancers. In addition, malignant cells may be inadvertently transplanted from donors with cancer and may grow in the transplanted organ, invade surrounding structures, and produce widespread metastases. Cancers may also develop in nontransplant patients treated with immunosuppressive therapy. There is also much circumstantial evidence suggesting that cancer chemotherapy, while allowing control of one cancer, may permit or induce the growth of a second neoplasm. These findings have important implications for the management of patients with malignancies, as other forms of cancer treatment such as radical surgical procedures and radiotherapy may also impair the host's resistance to cancer. It therefore behooves us to reappraise our methods of cancer therapy and examine their effects upon the host's resistance to his neoplasm.},

Ideally, an algorithm should possess asymptotic annihilation of the high-frequency response, i.e. spurious oscillations are eliminated after one time step. Numerous one-step algorithms, spectrally equivalent to linear multistep (LMS) methods, have been developed which include controlled numerical dissipation. This paper proves that the only unconditionally stable, second-order accurate, 3-step LMS method possessing asymptotic annihilation is Houbolt's method, which is known to be overly dissipative in the low-frequency regime. Thus, using LMS methods, obtaining asymptotic annihilation with little low-frequency dissipation requires at least a 4-step method.},

For reservoirs consisting of multiple rock types with differing capillary pressure properties, it is shown that traditional Bubnov-Galerkin methods give poor results and the new Petrov–Galerkin formulations are required. Investigations regarding the behaviour of several preconditioned conjugate-gradient-like methods in these type of problems are also reported.},

Soil nitrate content and EC increased significantly to 120 cm depth with increasing rates of applied N. An opposite trend was found for soil pH within the upper 20 cm. Cumulative N2O emission and maximum N2O emission rates both increased significantly with increasing N rates. Tomato yield increased significantly from the N0 to N1 rate, but remained constant from the N1 to N2 one. Nitrate concentration in tomatoes also increased significantly with N rates. A contrasting trend was found for soluble sugar and organic acid concentrations. The results indicate that the commonly used N2 rate is excessive and causes adverse effects on tomato quality and on the environment. The recommended N1 rate is optimal for sustainable greenhouse vegetable production.

Thirty male patients, aged 32 to 75 years, underwent a six week walking programme. After an introductory interview, the patients completed a self-administered questionnaire and maintained an exercise log book, indicating exercise frequency and duration for a six week period. Compliance was expressed as percentage duration and percentage frequency for the total six week period. The results showed an 86 per cent compliance rate to the exercise programme. It was concluded that such training is a valuable and economical strategy in cardiac rehabilitation programmes.},

Immunoglobulins (IgG, A, M) are a heterogenous group of proteins contained in the gamma, beta, and alpha-2 electrophoretic fractions of serum proteins. The IgG was found to be significantly increased in patients with cancer of the skin and lung, but decreased in patients with cancer of the prostate and breast. Serum IgM was reported to be elevated in patients with sarcoma, melanoma, brain tumors, but decreased in patients with carcinoma of the ovary. Serum IgA was found to be elevated in patients with cancer of epithelial secretory organs, such as skin, breast, head and neck, lung, gut, prostate, and uterine cervix.

The forcing fields are the Florida State University observed winds, winds derived from the NASA Scatterometer (NSCAT), and stresses derived directly from NSCAT. The sea level data sets are the World Ocean Circulation Experiment “fast” sea level data set from island measurements and sea level anomalies from TOPEX/POSEIDON. Results of this comparison demonstrate that while the three model results are qualitatively similar, the results are quantitatively better when forcing with the NSCAT derived stresses. This is particularly true in the eastern tropical Pacific and in convergent zones where forcing with the NSCAT stresses can lead to large differences in ULT (>40 m) compared with results from the other two wind products.},

A fully non-linear numerical model of coupled heat and mass transfer is used to analyse the one dimensional drying of a stratum of loam. The distribution of moisture content in the upper 0.5 m of soil is the subject of interest. Assumed representative material parameters are used.The results show small but significant changes in moisture content variations when either the value of the thermal conductivity or the heat capacity alone is kept constant. When both are held constant, however, a cancellation of effects occurs. This is attributed to the fact that the thermal gradients in the soil remain largely unchanged when compared with fully non-linear values. Actual magnitudes of temperatures are different but the thermal gradients are not.These conclusions cannot be generalized at this stage beyond the problem dependent results achieved. The results are, however, viewed as a contribution to a greater overall understanding of the complex problem under consideration.},

  abstract  = {Summary.  The purpose of the present study was to determine whether conventional resistance training alters 24-h ambulatory and manually determined casual blood pressure of normotensive women. Seven individuals (23 ± 2 years old) trainined 2 days week1 for 20 weeks emphasizing the hip and knee extensor muscle groups. Three sets to exhaustion of the knee extension, squat, knee flexion and leg press exercises were performed. The load for each exercise represented approximately 8045% of the one-repetition maximum. Average values for 24-h ambulatory blood pressure were not different (P>0·05) pre- and post-training (systolic, 107 ± 4 vs. 109±1 mmHg; diastolic, 73±2 vs. 71±2 mmHg). Ambulatory values over 8-h segments of the 24 h (day, evening, night) and casual resting determinations of blood pressure were also not affected. The lack of change in blood pressure cannot be explained by an insufficient training response. Knee extensor strength during dynamic or isokinetic actions increased (˜43%, P<0·05). In addition, biopsies from the vastus lateralis muscle showed an increase (P<0·05) in average muscle fibre cross-sectional area of 32%. This hypertrophic response was further substantiated by an increase (P<0·05) in lean body mass (41·2±1·3 kg to 43·4±1·5 kg). These results indicate that resistance training, which increases muscular strength, muscle fibre area and lean body mass, does not alter ambulatory or casual blood pressure. Thus, the concern that conventional resistance training may chronically elevate blood pressure does not appear warranted, at least in normotensive women.},

  abstract = {The accuracy of the SeaWinds scatterometer's vector winds is assessed through comparison with research vessel observations. Factors that contribute to uncertainty in scatterometer winds are isolated and examined as functions of wind speed. For SeaWinds on QuikSCAT, ambiguity selection is found to be near perfect for surface wind speed (w) > 8 m s−1; however, ambiguity selection errors cause directional uncertainty to exceed 20° for w < ∼5 m s−1. These average uncertainties for wind speed and direction are found to be 0.45 m s−1 and 5° for the QSCAT-1 model function and 0.3 m s−1 and 3° for the Ku-2000 model function. The QuikSCAT winds are examined as vectors through two new approaches. The first is a method for determining vector correlations that considers uncertainty in the comparison data set. The second approach is a wind speed-dependent model for the uncertainty in the magnitude of vector errors. For the QSCAT-1 (Ku-2000) model function this approach shows ambiguity selection dominates uncertainty for 2.5 < w < 5.5 m s−1 (0.6 < w < 5.5 m s−1), uncertainty in wind speed dominates for w < 2.5 m s−1 and 5.5 < w < 7.5 m s−1 (w < 0.6 m s−1 and 5.5 < w < 18 m s−1), and uncertainty in wind direction (for correctly selected ambiguities) dominates for w > 7.5 m s−1 (w > 18 m s−1). This approach also shows that spatial variability in the wind direction, related to inexact spatial co-location, is likely to dominate rms differences between scatterometer wind vectors and in situ comparison measurements for w > 4.5 m s−1. The techniques used herein are applicable to any validation effort with uncertainty in the comparison data set or with inexact co-location.},

  abstract  = {Growth of intrapleurally injected cells of immunogenic methylcholanthrene-induced rat sarcomas was suppressed by intrapleural injection of viable or 1 × 106 R radiationsterilized BCG vaccine. As little as 10 μg moist weight of organisms was effective, and treatment could be given several days before or after tumour challenge. Pleural effusion growth of a moderately immunogenic ascitic hepatoma was also controlled by intrapleurally administered BCG. In contrast, BCG injected intravenously, subcutaneously or intraperitoneally was without influence on pleural tumour growths. Similarly, intraperitoneal growth of these tumours was suppressed only by intraperitoneal injection of BCG. With two other transplanted tumours, a chemically induced mammary carcinoma and a spontaneous sarcoma, both of which lack significant immunogenicity, BCG treatment of pleural and peritoneal growths was less successful and more variable. Nevertheless, these studies indicate the potential of this type of treatment of thoracic and peritoneal tumour deposits for possible clinical application in the treatment of malignant mesothelioma.},

  abstract = {A three-dimensional hydrodynamic and sediment transport model was used to study the relative impact of (1) vegetation, (2) micro-topography, and (3) water level fluctuations on the spatial flow and sedimentation patterns in a tidal marsh landscape during single inundation events. The model incorporates three-dimensional (3-D) effects of vegetation on the flow (drag and turbulence). After extensive calibration and validation against field data, the model showed that the 3-D vegetation structure is determinant for the flow and sedimentation patterns. As long as the water level is below the top of the vegetation, differences in flow resistance between vegetated and unvegetated areas result in faster flow routing over unvegetated areas, so that vegetated areas are flooded from unvegetated areas, with flow directions more or less perpendicular to the vegetation edge. At the vegetation edge, flow velocities are reduced and sediments are rapidly trapped. In contrast, in between vegetated areas, flow velocities are enhanced, resulting in reduced sedimentation or erosion. As the water level overtops the vegetation, the flow paths described above change to more large-scale sheet flow crossing both vegetated and unvegetated areas. As a result, sedimentation patterns are then spatially more homogeneous. Our results suggest that the presence of a vegetation cover is the key factor controlling the long-term geomorphic development of tidal marsh landforms, leading to the formation of (1) unvegetated tidal channels and (2) vegetated platforms with a levee-basin topography in between these channels.},

  abstract  = {Rock socketed piles have a number of features which differentiate them from other types of piles. The generally stubby geometry leads to more even distribution of capacity between shaft and base. However, the low ratio of pile modulus to rock modulus leads to high compressibility and this, coupled with a tendency for the load transfer response along the shaft to exhibit strain-softening, gives rise to an overall response where the shaft capacity may be fully mobilized, and potentially degraded, before significant mobilization of base load.The paper presents results of finite element analyses of the response of rock-socketed piles, with particular attention to the shaft response with and without intimate base contact. The shaft interface uses a model, developed from principles of tribology, that includes dilation (and strain-hardening) prior to peak shaft friction, followed by strain-softening at larger displacements. The results of the study are shown to be consistent with field measurements, and to capture effects of the absolute pile diameter on the peak shaft friction. It is also shown that intimate base contact mitigates significantly the degree of strain-softening of the shaft response.},

Plasma insulin levels are decreased by training particularly in obesity and glucose tolerance seems to be improved. Training leads also in general to diminished body fat, but this is not obligatory for the plasma insulin decrease. There are no changes in concentrations of amino acids growth hormone or catecholamines, which can explain the insulin decrease. Cortisol is decreased the days after an acute exercise as well as after training in parallel with the plasma insulin decrease. The cortisol decrease may lead to changes in insulin receptor density in tissues leading to increased insulin sensitivity. The insulin decrease seems to be due to both a decreased production (to about 2/3) and an increased clearance (to about 1/3). Physical training leads to a decrease in plasma triglycerides and to a decrease in blood pressure. All these effects of physical training seem to be beneficial in the treatment of diabetes mellitus.},

Within a time step, the displacement for a single degree of freedom system is approximated by a function which is cubic in time. The four coefficients of the cubic are chosen to satisfy the two initial conditions and two weighted integral equations. By considering general weight functions, six additional coefficients arise. In a series of steps, these coefficients are selected to (i) maximize algebraic accuracy by matching terms of Taylor's expansions of exact and approximate solutions, (ii) ensure unconditional stability and (iii) optimize numerical conditioning of the equations in a limiting case. Equations required to implement the procedure are presented. The method as presented has no algorithmic damping of higher modes, although it is indicated how this may be achieved. The error in period elongation obtained using the proposed method is shown to be far less than using alternative procedures. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract  = {The finite element method has been well established for numerically solving parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs). Also it is well known that a too large time step should not be chosen in order to obtain a stable and accurate numerical solution. In this article, accuracy analysis shows that a too small time step should not be chosen either for some time-stepping schemes. Otherwise, the accuracy of the numerical solution cannot be improved or can even be worsened in some cases. Furthermore, the so-called minimum time step criteria are established for the Crank-Nicolson scheme, the Galerkin-time scheme, and the backward-difference scheme used in the temporal discretization. For the forward-difference scheme, no minimum time step exists as far as the accuracy is concerned. In the accuracy analysis, no specific initial and boundary conditions are invoked so that such established criteria can be applied to the parabolic PDEs subject to any initial and boundary conditions. These minimum time step criteria are verified in a series of numerical experiments for a one-dimensional transient field problem with a known analytical solution. The minimum time step criteria developed in this study are useful for choosing appropriate time steps in numerical simulations of practical engineering problems. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The protein purity of the six final antibody preparations assayed was always ≥97%.

The present study tested these hypotheses by determining, in both free-living and institutionalized elderly men, the correlations of bone mineral density (BMD), total body bone mineral content (TBBMC) and lean body mass (LBM) with the following predictor variables: age, body mass index, body weight, serum insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), serum testosterone, habitual physical activity and mobility.SUBJECTS Forty-nine independent, community-dwelling older men, and 49 men of similar age residing in two Veterans Administration extended care facilities. The age range was 58–95 years.MEASUREMENTS Serum IGF-I and testosterone were measured by radioimmunoassay. Habitual physical activity in the independent men and mobility in the institutionalized men were estimated by standard instruments. LBM and bone status at nine skeletal sites were determined by dual X-ray absorptiometry.RESULTS The BMD and TBBMC values of the free living men were 4–20% higher than those of the institutionalized men. In the independent old men, serum testosterone was the strongest predictor of BMD and TBBMC, while age was the only predictor of LBM. In the chronically institutionalized men, age, body weight and immobility were the strongest predictors of body composition, and testosterone was correlated only with femoral neck BMD.CONCLUSIONS In aging independent men, low levels of testosterone are associated with demineralization of the skeleton. Immobility and under-weight are associated with the osteopenia of old men residing in nursing homes. In this cross-sectional study of elderly men, there was no evidence of a relation of the somatotrophic axis to bone status or LBM, or of the gonadotrophic axis to LBM.},

 The proposed schemes are fractional step methods associated with a two phase operator split of the full non-linear system of thermoelasticity into an adiabatic elastodynamics phase, followed by a heat conduction phase at fixed configuration. This operator split is shown to inherit the contractivity property of the full problem of evolution, thus leading to unconditionally B-stable product formula algorithms. In sharp contrast with this stability result, traditional staggered algorithms based on an isothermal mechanical phase followed by a heat conduction phase with an effective heat source are shown to lead, at best, to conditionally stable schemes. It is further shown that the actual implementation of these two classes of schemes is essentially identical. The numerical simulations presented include both dynamic and quasi-static problems and are shown to closely replicate the stability estimates and non-linear stability results derived for these two classes of staggered schemes.},

The conclusions were that endolymphatic isotope therapy was justified in specialized centres where good results could be obtained. Further animal experiments using the VX2 tumour in rabbits indicated that BCG given intracutaneously or intravenously had no therapeutic effect, whereas when applied by intralymphatic injection BCG was successful in treating lymph node metastases. Nineteen patients with poor-prognosis malignant melanoma have received endolymphatic BCG. The clinical results are recorded in this paper and are sufficiently encouraging to warrant its continued use.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents a new numerical algorithm for 2D nonisothermal time-stepping simulations of a nonlinear viscoelastic cast film process. A significant contribution of the algorithm is that an updated Lagrangian description of motion is employed, as opposed to the more conventional Eulerian description generally used for continuous polymer processing simulations. Furthermore, use is made of a Perzynatype constitutive equation, which is different from what is usually employed for molten polymers. The constitutive equation accommodates viscoelasticity, extensional thinning/thickening, and strain-hardening. This new numerical algorithm can find the steady-state film properties, and it can predict the onset of instability by observing draw resonance. The critical draw ratio is determined from the response problem, which means that the mathematical complications of the more common linear stability analysis are avoided. In terms of the stability of the film, it was observed that stability is decreased by extensional thinning, strain-hardening, and higher relaxation times, and stability is increased by higher heat transfer coefficients and higher ratios of air-gap length to die width.},

Except in the case of walking, multiple regression analyses revealed that intentions for each physical activity type were influenced by affective attitude and perceived behavioral control. Behavior, however, was predicted by intentions alone. In comparison with other types of activity, the TPB accounted for modest amounts of variance in both walking intentions and behavior, with attitudes making no contribution to walking intentions. Discussion focuses on the measurement of physical activity and the implications for health promotion of the poor modeling of walking.},

It is derived from the difference of the solutions between an ordinary integration method (the Newmark scheme) and another higher-order one which assumes that the derivatives of accelerations vary linearly within each time step. It may be obtained directly without resolving new equations, so the additional computational cost is small and the implementation is convenient. Furthermore, it is shown that this error estimator may also be obtained by Taylor expansion or by a post-processing technique. Accordingly, an adaptive time-stepping procedure, which automatically adjusts the time-step size so that the local error at each time step is within a prescribed accuracy, is described. Numerical examples, including two single-DOF problems, a two-DOF problem and a multi-DOF model, are presented. The results show that the presented local error estimator is simple, reliable and accurate.},

The electromagnetic field equations are written in terms of the magnetic vector potential for the infinite domain, and 3-D mapped infinite eiement formulation based on these equations is presented in detail. A series of magnetostatics and eddy current problems are solved to demonstrate the validity and efficiency of the procedure. These numerical results indicate that the combined finite–infinite element procedure is computationally much more economical for the solution of unbounded electromagnetic problems, especially when using the vector potential formulation, as the number of system equations decreases substantially compared to the finite element only procedure.

  abstract  = {The Newmark average acceleration method is non-dissipative and unconditionally stable, but its accuracy in transient analysis of wave propagation problems depends not only on the spatial discretization but also on the temporal discretization. It has been found that the effects of spatial and temporal discretization when considered separately as commonly done, are far from adequate for most transient analysis. A better criterion manipulating the interdependent relationship between mesh size and time-step magnitude is imperative to achieve sufficiently accurate results of analysis. In this paper, the accuracy of the Newmark method is investigated by considering the two basic sources of errors, namely, numerical amplitude dissipation and velocity dispersion. The effects of both spatial and temporal discretizations are considered. A new technique to describe the characteristics of various frequency spectra is established. A criterion for mesh design and the selection of time-step magnitude is also proposed based on the combined effects of the amplitude dissipation and velocity dispersion. The efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed criterion are demonstrated using two one-dimensional wave propagation problems. A two-dimensional application shows that this criterion is equally applicable to multidimensional problems.},

The solution method is simpler than an alternative suggested by Park15 and has a direct physical interpretation. This stabilized procedure is efficient in numerical time domain analysis of soil-pore fluid occurring in earthquake and consolidation problems. Numerical examples of one and two dimensional saturated poroelastic media demonstrate the procedure.},

The model is designed to take advantage of digital elevation data bases and of information extracted from these data bases by topographic analysis. The practical application of the model is demonstrated in simulations of a small subcatchment of the Konza Prairie reserve near Manhattan, Kansas. In a preliminary investigation of computational issues related to model resolution, we obtain satisfactory numerical results using large aspect ratios, suggesting that horizontal grid dimensions may not be unreasonably constrained by the typically much smaller vertical length scale of a catchment and by vertical discretization requirements. Additional tests are needed to examine the effects of numerical constraints and parameter heterogeneity in determining acceptable grid aspect ratios. In other simulations we attempt to match the observed streamflow response of the catchment, and we point out the small contribution of the streamflow component to the overall water balance of the catchment.},

  abstract  = {A modification (Irons;6 Concus et al.1) to the conjugate gradient (CG) method by Hestenes and Stiefel5 has recently renewed the interest in this elegant technique which appears to be extraordinarily promising for large sparse systems Ax = b, where A is a symmetric positive definite matrix. A good approximation K−1 for the inverse of A is needed in the modified algorithm. For finite difference sets of equations, Meijerink and van der Vorst9 and Kershaw7 have experienced a very fast convergence with a matrix K−1 determined by the incomplete Cholesky decomposition of A.A further acceleration of the iteration may be achieved by preliminarily processing the initial guessed solution by the Newton iterative scheme before using the modified conjugate gradient (MCG) method. The initial Newton iterations (NI) have the useful property of significantly reducing the components of the residual r0 along the eigenvectors of AK−1 associated with the eigenvalues lying in the vicinity of 1. The latter are expected to include the vast majority of the eigenvalues of AK−1. As a result the MCG method is left with a smaller number of r0 components to set to zero in a reduced dimensional eigenvector space and hence the solution is arrived at in fewer iterations. Depending on the desired final accuracy, up to 50 per cent of the MCG iterations may be equivalently replaced by an equal number of NI which are computationally faster.This approach has been applied to the solution of finite element sets of linear equations arising from the arbitrarily irregular triangle discretization of groundwater flow domains in both steady and unsteady conditions. For diagonally dominant matrices the results emphasize the excellent performance of the MCG method which proved much faster than the first-degree Chebyshev iteration (CHI) and required a number of iterations an order of magnitude smaller than the successive over-relaxation technique (SOR) with optimum over-relaxation factor.},

  abstract = {We have developed a model that simulates aspects of initial channel formation in a youthful salt marsh environment. The model mimics the evolution of the cross section of a channel by coupling calculations of bottom shear stresses caused by tidal motions with erosion, taking into account the deposition of cohesive sediments. The simulations characterize flow in a reference cross section that includes an incipient channel zone and a marsh surface zone, with assigned water surface level and initial bottom elevation. This model mimics key characteristics of salt marshes where discharges due to tidal motion repeat in time with approximately the same magnitude and water surface level. Significant reductions in the tidal prism due to increasing bottom elevation above mean sea level, however, are not treated. Rather, the model is suitable for youthful salt marshes where relatively large water depths are maintained. Prolonged deposition reduces the area available for flow and thereby changes the shear stress distribution at the bottom, leading locally to erosion and alteration of the channel cross section. The simulations suggest that two mechanisms contribute to the longitudinal widening exhibited by salt marsh channels, which typically is disproportionately greater than that exhibited by river channels. The short duration of the maximum discharge (spring tide) and corresponding erosion rates, when compared with deposition rates, prevent the channel from reaching a deep, narrow equilibrium configuration. Furthermore, autoconsolidation of cohesive sediments, often occurring in salt marsh environments, leads to a downward increase in the resistance of the sediment to erosion. As scour occurs locally, the flow encounters more resistant sediment layers; so rather than deepening the channel over a narrow zone, flow and bottom stresses become more uniformly distributed leading to a wider channel than would otherwise occur in the absence of autoconsolidation. Based on flow and sediment properties estimated for the Venice Lagoon, Italy, simulations are consistent with observations of salt marsh creeks at this location.},

The four coefficients of the cubic are chosen to satisfy the two initial conditions and two weighted integral equations. By considering general weight functions, eight additional coefficients arise. These coefficients are selected to (i) minimize the difference between exact and approximate solutions for small time steps, (ii) incorporate specified algorithmic damping for large time steps, (iii) ensure unconditional stability and (iv) minimize numerical operations in forming the amplification matrix.

These NRCS data are first collocated with numerous National Data Busy Center buoys (within ±0.5° latitude and longitude) and are then processed using the new Weissman et al. [1994] Frontal Air-Sea Interaction Experiment model to produce 25-km by 25-km spatial averages of the friction velocity for several contiguous areas within this region. One method of validation of these estimates involves comparisons with friction velocity estimates derived from data collected by the buoys using bulk methods. This was conducted at numerous locations; the Atlantic and Pacific coastlines and within the Gulf of Mexico. It is found that there is excellent agreement between these two different measurements. In addition, this approach enabled the derivation of estimates of the surface drag coefficient, with the use of the buoy winds, neutral stability winds at 10-m elevation, U10N, and the scatterometer surface friction velocity u*. This permitted the study of the dependence of this drag coefficient CD on wind speed in these different regions on spatial scales, which had not previously been possible. Comparisons are made to previously published models of CD that only depend on wind speed, with generally good agreement at winds over 6 m−1 s, but with significant regional differences at winds less than 6 m−1 s.},

An alternative algorithm is developed which exactly preserves energy, and the total spatial angular momentum in incremental force-free motions. The implicit version of this algorithm is unconditionally stable and second order accurate. The explicit version conserves exactly angular momentum in incremental force-free motions. Numerical simulations are presented which illustrate the excellent performance of the proposed procedure, even for incremental rotations over 65 degrees.

For the implicit family of algorithms unconditional stability, consistency, convergence, accuracy and overshoot properties are first discussed and proved. On the basis of the algorithmic damping ratio (dissipation) and period elongation (dispersion) the ρ-method is then compared with the well-known implicit algorithms of Hilber, Newmark, Wilson, Park and Houbolt. An explicit version of the algorithm is also derived and briefly discussed. This shows numerical properties similar to the central difference method.

There has been a 15% increase in deaths from cancer in males and a 9% decrease in the female population per 100,000 during the past 15–20 years. It appears more and more likely that viruses play a vital role in the development of human cancer, thus raising the possibility of development of an anti-cancer vaccine, although many questions remain unanswered. A great deal of research has been done on tumor antigenicity and the use of anti-tumor vaccines in animals since 1943 when Gross first reported regression of intradermal sarcoma following injection of autoantibodies. Since that time cancer antibodies have been found to be produced by the human being, and it has been shown conclusively that some people have a resistance to cancer whereas others may have little or none. Surgery, irradiation, and chemotherapy remain the only three effective methods of treatment, although the latter cannot as yet be considered curative. Until a marked improvement is attained in anticancer drugs it is the author's opinion that the greatest possiblity of significant improvement in results of treatment for cancer lies in the development of effective combinations of methods.},

Dazu kann die Bereitstellung fettarmer bzw. fettreduzierter Lebensmittel beitragen. Die Herabsetzung des Fettgehalts führt jedoch zu sensorischen, küchentechnischen und technologischen Qualitätsverlusten. Dem kann die Substitution des Nahrungsfetts entweder mit Fettersatz-oder mit Fettaustauschstoffen entgegenwirken. Fettersatzstoffe ähneln den Speisefetten in ihren physikalischen Eigenschaften (z.B. Hydrophobie, Schmelzverhalten, Aussehen, Temperaturbeständigkeit). Dazu gehören Triglyceride, Kohlenhydratpolyester, Retrofette, Fettsäureether. Ihr Gehalt an metabolisierbarer Energie ist zu vernachlässigen. Fettaustauschstoffe simulieren vorrangig die sensorischen Eigenschaften des Nahrungsfetts. Darunter fallen mikropartikulierte Proteine sowie Kohlenhydrate, z.B. Inulin, Stärke und Dextrine und stark wasserbindende Quellstoffe. Wegen ihrer toxikologischen Unbedenklichkeit und guten sensorischen Qualität dürften Fettaustauschstoffe die künftige Entwicklung auf dem Gebiet der Fettsubstitution bestimmen.},

  abstract  = {The simulation of slowly varying electromagnetic fields is possible for very large, realistic problems with finite-difference implicit time-domain (FDiTD) and frequency-domain (FDFD) formulations on the basis of the consistent Finite-Integration Technique (FIT). Magneto-quasistatic time-domain formulations combined with implicit time marching schemes require the repeated solution of real-valued symmetric systems. The solution of driven frequency domain problems usually consists in the solution of one non-Hermitean system. Preconditioned conjugate gradient-type methods are well-suited for this task. They allow the efficient solution even for consistent singular or near-singular systems, which typically arise from formulations for slowly varying electromagnetic fields using the Maxwell-Grid-Equations of the FI-Method. Numerical results for TEAM workshop 11 benchmark problem and for a large practical problem, a shading ring sensor, show that the presented algorithms are capable of solving realistic problems for large numbers of unknowns in acceptable calculation times on contemporary medium sized workstations.

The majority of ALS cases are acquired spontaneously, with inherited disease accounting for only 10 % of all cases. Recent studies provide compelling evidence that aggregates of misfolded proteins underlie both types of ALS. Small molecules such as artificial chaperones can prevent or even reverse the aggregation of proteins associated with various human diseases. However, their very high active concentration (micromolar range) severely limits their utility as drugs. We synthesized several ester and amide derivatives of chemical chaperones. The lead compound 14, 3-((5-((4,6-dimethylpyridin-2-yl)methoxy)-5-oxopentanoyl)oxy)-N,N-dimethylpropan-1-amine oxide shows, in the micromolar concentration range, both neuronal and astrocyte protective effects in vitro; at daily doses of 10 mg kg−1 14 improved the neurological functions and delayed body weight loss in ALS mice. Members of this new chemical chaperone derivative class are strong candidates for the development of new drugs for ALS patients.},

Here an alternative SRSS procedure is developed using the so-called mode acceleration approach of structural dynamics. The design input in this procedure is defined in terms of relative acceleration and relative velocity spectra. The relative spectra can be related to pseudo spectra. For a given number of modes to be included in the analysis the new SRSS rule proposed here will reduce the error due to the so-called ‘missing mass’ effect and predict a more accurate response value than the rules which use pseudo spectra as input, for systems either with or without dominant high frequency mode effects.},

  abstract  = {Exact natural frequencies are determined for the torsional vibration of pretwisted thin-walled open-profile bars having torsionally clamped and pinned end restraints. The equation of motion and boundary conditions are derived from a multifilament model of a pretwisted thin-walled bar undergoing warp deformation and a moderately large twist about the elastic axis. Closed-form torsional frequencies and mode shapes are derived from the linear terms of the resulting non-linear equations. As the length-to-leg ratio (L/b) and leg-to-thickness ratio (b/t) of typical open-profile bars are varied, the individual and collective effects of warping and pretwist on the non-dimensional torsional frequencies are demarcated. In addition, the closed-form solutions offered here reveal considerable destiffening of the torsional frequencies due to warping-pretwist coupling present in thin-walled bars having pretwisted, unsymmetrical, open-profiles and torsionally clamped and pinned end restraints. This coupling effect, which have been ignored in thin-walled bar vibration theories hitherto, is brought out by the Wagner effect and warping shear stresses acting on the profiles.},

Results obtained by using the present improved theory have been observed to be close lower bound solutions. The convergence has been found to be rapid in comparison with the classical first-order finite difference method. While the computational space and time required by the present approach is observed to be almost the same as that required by the first-order theory for a given mesh size, accuracies of practical interest can be obtained by using the improved finite difference procedure with a relatively smaller matrix size, in contrast to the classical finite difference procedure which requires either a larger matrix or an extrapolation procedure for improvement in accuracy.},

Numerical solutions, obtained by using finite time differences and infinite polynomials, are presented for the response of a twenty-storey building with six shear walls to an impact load and earthquake accelerations.It is shown that omission of the axial deformations results in a substantially distorted pattern of behaviour, some of its effects being:
* 1Overestimation of the bending stiffness of the coupled shear walls, with corresponding changes in their stiffness ratios.
* 2Underestimation of the periods of the principal modes, with a corresponding change in the dynamic response.
* 3Distortion of the magnitude, form, time of onset and coupling of the maximum displacements.
* 4Pronounced change in the shear force and moment diagrams for the shear walls, the beams and the building as a whole.},

We present new coupling staggered procedures where momentum conservation is enforced at the interface. This is done by using a structural predictor. Continuity of structural and fluid grid displacements is not satisfied at the fluid/structure interface. However, we show on a two-degree-of-freedom aerofoil that this new type of method has many advantages, e.g. accuracy of conservation at the interface and extended stability.

A multi-variable search method was employed to estimate these optimum parameters. Two different optimization studies were performed. The resultant optimum four-level-time schemes produced very accurate results, satisfied physical reality, and did not produce any oscillations for the specific problems that were studied. The optimum values for the three parameters α, β and γ in the four-level-time scheme were α = 16.72, β = 6.26 and γ = 2.46. The optimum value of θ for the Wilson-θ method was θ = 1.42. The optimum schemes were compared to some existing four-level-time schemes. The outcome demonstrated that the optimum schemes were superior. The Houbolt method and the Galerkin weighting procedure were shown to have greater inaccuracies than the optimum schemes.},

The necessary numerical techniques are analysed from the point of view of accuracy, performance and storage requirements when implemented in scalar and vector processors with large storage capacity. The method is implemented on an IBM 3090 with vector facility.For this implementation we consider five different time integration schemes (explicit and implicit central difference, Houbolt, constant average acceleration and Wilson), and in the implicit case, both direct (Gaussian decomposition) and iterative (successive over-relaxation, Jacobi semi-iterative, Jacobi conjugate gradient) sparse linear systems solvers. These solvers are taken from the ITPACK2C and ESSL libraries using in each case the adequate representation scheme; skyline, row-wise and compressed diagonal.From our results it is concluded that constant average acceleration and explicit central difference are the most adequate integration methods and Jacobi conjugate gradient is the most efficient solver.},

This procedure gives a unique consistent definition of sectional moments and generalized forces. Some simple explicit formulae are derived for homogeneous tension–torsion. For the general case a computer code is developed on the basis of discretized generalized displacements and a modified energy functional, devised to obtain consistent lengthwise variation of the stresses and a unique decomposition of the torsional moment. Examples show agreement with analytical results for cylindrical beams and illustrate the various coupling effects for beams with pretwist. They also demonstrate the usefulness of the explicit formulae for homogeneous tension–torsion.},

These difference formulae are almost invariably based on Lagrange type differentiation formulae. However, if it is known in advance that periodic components of given frequency are dominating in the solution, more accurate difference formulae, based on exponentials with imaginary exponent, are available. This paper derives such formulae and presents numerical results which clearly indicate that the accuracy can be improved considerably by exploiting additional knowledge on the frequencies of the solution.},

   condition. Accordingly, strong and weak boundary conditions give
   essentially identical results on meshes that are stretched to better
   capture boundary layers. However, on uniform meshes that are incapable
   of resolving boundary layers, weakly imposed boundary conditions deliver
   significantly more accurate mean flow quantities than their strong
   counterparts. Hence, weakly imposed boundary conditions present a robust
   technique for flows of industrial interest, where optimal mesh design is

  abstract  = {{Purpose: The beneficial effect of exercise in the retardation of the
   progression of cardiovascular disease is hypothesized to be caused, at
   least in part, by the elimination of adverse hemodynamic conditions,
   including flow recirculation and low wall shear stress. In vitro and in
   vivo investigations have provided qualitative and limited quantitative
   information on flow patterns in the abdominal aorta and on the effect of
   exercise on the elimination of adverse hemodynamic conditions. We used
   computational fluid mechanics methods to examine the effects of
   simulated exercise on hemodynamic conditions in an idealized model of
   the human abdominal aorta.
   Methods: A three-dimensional computer model of a healthy human abdominal
   aorta was created to simulate pulsatile aortic blood flow under
   conditions of rest and graded exercise. Plow velocity patterns and wall
   shear stress were computed in the lesion-prone infrarenal aorta, and the
   effects of exercise were determined.
   Results: A recirculation zone was observed to form along the posterior
   wall of the aorta immediately distal to the renal vessels under resting
   conditions. Low time-averaged wall shear stress was present in this
   location, along the posterior wall opposite the superior mesenteric
   artery and along the anterior wall between the superior and inferior
   mesenteric arteries. Shear stress temporal oscillations, as measured
   with an oscillatory shear index, were elevated in these regions. Under
   simulated Light exercise conditions, a region of low wall shear stress
   and high oscillatory shear index remained along the posterior wall
   immediately distal to the renal arteries. Under simulated moderate
   exercise conditions, all the regions of low wall shear stress and high
   oscillatory shear index were eliminated.
   Conclusion: This numeric investigation provided detailed quantitative
   data on the effect of exercise on hemodynamic conditions in the
   abdominal aorta. Our results indicated that moderate levels of lower
   limb exercise are necessary to eliminate the flow reversal and regions
   of low wall shear stress in the abdominal aorta that exist under resting
   conditions. The lack of flow reversal and increased wall shear stress
   during exercise suggest a mechanism by which exercise may promote
   arterial health, namely with the elimination of adverse hemodynamic
   conditions.}},

   Using weighted collocation in the transition regions between
   hierarchical levels, we are able to reliably handle coincident

   abscissae. The resulting method combines the favorable properties of

   York, 2004) in the context of compressible flows, is applied to a
   time-dependent, scalar advection-diffusion equation with the purpose of
   modelling drug delivery processes in blood vessels. The formulation is
   recast in a residual-based form, which reduces to the previously
   proposed formulation in the limit of zero diffusion and source term. The
   NURBS-based isogeometric analysis method, proposed by Hughes et al.
   (Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Eng. 2005; 194:4135-4195) was used for the

   discontinuity capturing is necessary to improve solution quality, we
   find that high-order, high-continuity B-spline discretizations produce
   sharp, nearly monotone layers without the aid of discontinuity
   capturing. Finally, we successfully apply the YZ beta approach to the

   earlier, is generalized to higher dimensions. The key idea is the
   identification of the line scale field with a component of the
   displacement that has a large gradient. The difference between the total
   displacement and the line scale is the coarse scale field. The
   formulation is variationally based, with the weak form as the point of
   departure. With suitable assumptions on the space of fine scale fields,
   the weak form is separable into coarse and fine scale parts. The weak
   form of the Fine scale problem is used to eliminate the fine scales from
   the formulation. This is achieved by way of a projection onto the line
   scale space and allows a reformulation of the full problem in terms of
   coarse scale components alone. In this framework, fine scale
   interpolations are identified that ensure sharp resolution of localized
   displacement irrespective of the underlying finite element mesh. It is
   demonstrated that by correctly accounting for the ``microstructural{''}
   fine scale behavior, the formulation results in solutions devoid of
   pathological mesh sensitivity. For problems wherein the detailed
   structure of the localized displacement is of interest, recovery of the
   fine scale components can be performed to reconstruct the entire
   displacement field. Several numerical examples are presented that

  abstract  = {{This work approaches strain localization by recognizing the multiple
   scales inherent in the problem. A component associated with the region
   of localized strain (typically, one with high gradient) is referred to
   as the fine scale. It represents the microstructure. The field obtained
   by removing the fine scale from the total solution is referred to as the
   coarse scale. The aim of the multiple scale method advanced here is to
   derive a model for the coarse scale field that accounts for the finite
   scale. This process eliminates the fine scale from the problem, yet
   retains its effect. In applying this framework to the nonlinear problems
   with which localized strains are associated, a crucial step is a
   first-order approximation of the relevant relations. The fully nonlinear
   problem is solved by an iterative scheme. By accounting directly for the
   microstructure the multiple scale model recovers the regularizing
   effects of various alternative formulations for softening strain
   localization. It thus presents itself as a unifying framework for such
   models. Numerical solutions are shown to be invariant with respect to
   the discretization. Furthermore, for cases in which the displacements
   assume a distinct profile within the localization band, the multiple
   scale model provides a resolution that can be made as accurate as
   desired even with the coarsest mesh possible. The model is applied to
   strain localization problems that arise in inviscid and viscoplastic
   solids. Numerical simulations are presented that demonstrate the
   efficacy of the approach. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science S.A.}},

  abstract             = {{In three-dimensional blood flow simulations of the cardiovascular
   system, velocity and pressure fields in the computational domain are
   highly affected by outlet boundary conditions. This fact has motivated
   the development of novel methods to couple three-dimensional
   computational domains with one-dimensional numerical models or,
   alternatively, with zero-dimensional or one-dimensional analytic models.
   In all such methods described to date, whether they are explicit or
   implicit, the relationship between flow and pressure at the outlet
   boundary is enforced weakly. This coupling does not include any
   constraints on the shape of the velocity profiles nor on the
   distribution of pressure at the interface. As a result, there remain
   some classes of problems that are, at best, difficult to solve, and at
   worst, intractable, with current numerical methods for simulating blood
   flow. These include problems with significant flow reversal during part
   of the cardiac cycle or geometric complexity in the proximity of the
   outlet of the computational domain. We have implemented a novel method
   to resolve these challenging problems whereby an augmented Lagrangian
   method is used to enforce constraints on the shape of the velocity
   profile at the interface between the upstream computational domain and
   the downstream analytic domain. These constraints on the shape of the
   velocity profile are added to the Coupled Multidomain Method in order to
   implicitly couple the computational domain with downstream analytic
   models. In this study, an axi-symmetric profile is imposed after
   ensuring that each constrained outlet boundary is circular. We
   demonstrate herein that including constraints on the shape of the
   velocity profile does not affect velocity and pressure fields except in
   the immediate vicinity of the constrained outlet boundaries.
   Furthermore, this new method enables the solution of problems which
   diverged with an unconstrained method. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier

   generalization of classical Finite Element Analysis (FEA) which
   possesses improved properties. For example, NURBS are capable of more
   precise geometric representation of complex objects and, in particular,
   can exactly represent many commonly engineered shapes, such as
   cylinders, spheres and tori. Isogeometric Analysis also simplifies mesh
   refinement because the geometry is fixed at the coarsest level of
   refinement and is unchanged throughout the refinement process. This
   eliminates geometrical errors and the necessity of linking the
   refinement procedure to a CAD representation of the geometry, as in
   classical FEA. In this work we study approximation and stability
   properties in the context of h-refinement. We develop approximation
   estimates based on a new Bramble-Hilbert lemma in so-called ``bent{''}
   Sobolev spaces appropriate for NURBS approximations and establish
   inverse estimates similar to those for finite elements. We apply the
   theoretical results to several cases of interest including elasticity,
   isotropic incompressible elasticity and Stokes flow, and
   advection-diffusion, and perform numerical tests which corroborate the
   mathematical results. We also perform numerical calculations that
   involve hypotheses outside our theory and these suggest that there are

   influenced by the deformability of the vessel. Moreover, wave
   propagation phenomena in the cardiovascular system can only be described
   considering wall deformability since blood is usually described as an
   incompressible fluid. However, computational methods for simulating
   blood flow in three-dimensional models of arteries have either
   considered a rigid wall assumption for the vessel or significantly
   simplified or reduced geometries. Computing blood flow in deformable
   domains using standard techniques like the ALE method remains a
   formidable problem for large, realistic anatomic and physiologic models
   of the cardiovascular system.
   We have developed a new method to simulate blood flow in
   three-dimensional deformable models of arteries. The method couples the
   equations of the deformation of the vessel wall at the variational level
   as a boundary condition for the fluid domain. We consider a strong
   coupling of the degrees-of-freedom of the fluid and the solid domains,
   and a linear membrane model (enhanced with transverse shear) for the
   vessel wall. The effect of the vessel wall boundary is therefore added
   in a monolithic way to the fluid equations, resulting in a remarkably
   robust scheme. We present here the mathematical formulation of the
   method and discuss issues related to the fluid-solid coupling, membrane
   formulation, time integration method, and boundary and initial
   conditions. Implementation is discussed and results with simple
   geometries as well as large subject-specific models are presented. (c)

   method, the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method and stabilization
   techniques.
   A brief review of the CG method, the DG method and stabilization
   techniques highlights the advantages and disadvantages of these methods
   and suggests a new approach for the solution of fourth-order elliptic
   problems. A continuous/discontinuous Galerkin (C/DG) method is proposed
   which uses C-0-continuous interpolation functions and is formulated in
   the primary variable only. The advantage of this formulation over a more
   traditional mixed approach is that the introduction of additional
   unknowns and related difficulties can be avoided. In the context of thin
   bending theory, the C/DG method leads to a formulation where
   displacements are the only degrees of freedom, and no rotational degrees
   of freedom need to be considered.
   The main feature of the C/DG method is the weak enforcement of
   continuity of first and higher-order derivatives through stabilizing
   terms on interior boundaries. Consistency, stability and convergence of
   the method are shown analytically. Numerical experiments verify the
   theoretical results, and applications are presented for Bernoulli-Euler
   beam bending, Poisson-Kirchhoff plate bending and a shear layer problem

   three-dimensional geometric flexibility, compact support, and, most
   importantly, the possibility of C-1 and higher-order continuity. A
   NURBS-based variational formulation for the Cahn-Hilliard equation was
   tested on two- and three-dimensional problems. We present steady state
   solutions in two-dimensions and, for the first time, in
   three-dimensions. To achieve these results an adaptive time-stepping

   are employed in patients with severe heart failure. Although their
   emergence has significantly improved therapeutic options for patients

   configuration in which the LVAD is implanted in the descending thoracic
   aorta. We perform computations for three pump settings and report our

   structure. We then get down to business and describe our approach-the
   variational multiscale formulation of LES. Application is made to
   turbulent two-dimensional equilibrium and three-dimensional
   non-equilibrium Channel flows. Simple, constant-coefficient
   Smagorinsky-type eddy viscosities, without wall damping functions, are
   used to model the transfer of energy from small resolved scales to
   unresolved scales, an approach which is not viable within the
   traditional LES framework. Nevertheless, very good results are obtained.}},

   estimator, which is an explicit function of residuals and provides an
   upper bound on the global L(2)-norm of the error. An h-adaptive
   strategy, which does not require knowledge of the scaling constant
   appearing in the error estimator, is described. Numerical results for a
   two-dimensional model problem show that significant problem size
   reduction can be obtained through this adaptive approach. An algorithm
   is presented to compute the scaling constant, which leads to computable
   error estimates. The accuracy of the error estimates, indicated by the

   operators to obtain high-order collocation methods involving superior
   approximation and numerical integration schemes. The regularization is
   applicable to both singular and hyper-singular integral equations, and

   and r unknown coefficients in the approximate solution, the unknowns can
   be solved by the weighted residual method. The weighting parameter
   method is used to investigate the resultant algorithm characteristics.
   It is shown that the formulation is consistent with a minimum order of

   Unconditionally stable algorithms exist if m less than or equal to r for
   first-order equations and m + 1 less than or equal to r for second-order
   equations. Hence, the Dahlquist's theorem is generalized. Algorithms
   equivalent to the Pade approximations and unconditionally stable

   constructed. The corresponding weighting parameters and weighting

   into a sequence of constraint linear quadratic (LQ) optimal control
   problems. Then, the symplectic discretization form is applied to the

   employing a standard linear complementary solver. Because the proposed

   high accuracy and high efficiency numerical solutions can be obtained
   with large time interval and small iteration times. Meanwhile, the

   various types of optimal control problems are investigated to

   comprising the trigonometric functions are used to approximate the

   functions are constructed as interpolation functions so that the
   unknowns are the function values, rather than the Fourier coefficients.
   In the spirit of the differential quadrature method, the derivatives at
   a sampling grid point are expressed as weighted linear sums of function
   values at all the sampling grid points. It is shown that the
   corresponding weighting coefficients of higher order derivatives can be
   evaluated recursively and the general explicit formulae are given in

   equations can then be established easily at the sampling grid points.
   For the periodic boundary value problems, the periodic boundary
   conditions are satisfied automatically and no other boundary conditions
   are required in general. It is also shown that the harmonic differential
   quadrature method is related to the trigonometric collocation method and
   the harmonic balance method. Numerical examples are given to illustrate

   techniques and a posteriori error estimation. In this paper, a general
   recovery technique is developed for determining the derivatives
   (stresses) of the finite element solutions at nodes. The implementation
   of the recovery technique is simple and cost effective. The technique
   has been tested for a group of widely used linear, quadratic and cubic
   elements for both one and two dimensional problems. Numerical
   experiments demonstrate that the recovered nodal values of the
   derivatives with linear and cubic elements are superconvergent. One
   order higher accuracy is achieved by the procedure with linear and cubic
   elements but two order higher accuracy is achieved for the derivatives
   with quadratic elements. In particular, an 0(h4) convergence of the
   nodal values of the derivatives for a quadratic triangular element is
   reported for the first time. The performance of the proposed technique
   is compared with the widely used smoothing procedure of global L2
   projection and other methods. It is found that the derivatives recovered
   at interelement nodes, by using L2 projection, are also superconvergent
   for linear elements but not for quadratic elements. Numerical
   experiments on the convergence of the recovered solutions in the energy
   norm are also presented. Higher rates of convergence are again observed.
   The results presented in this part of the paper indicate clearly that a
   new, powerful and economical process is now available which should
   supersede the currently used post-processing procedures applied in most

   be generated according to the distribution of user specified element

  abstract             = {{In 1995 the two senior authors of the present paper introduced a new
   algorithm designed to replace the Taylor-Galerkin (or Lax-Wendroff)
   methods, used by them so far in the solution of compressible flow
   problems. The new algorithm was applicable to a wide variety of
   situations, including fully incompressible flows and shallow water
   equations, as well as supersonic and hypersonic situations, and has
   proved to be always at least as accurate as other algorithms currently
   used. The algorithm is based on the solution of conservation equations
   of fluid mechanics to avoid any possibility of spurious solutions that
   may otherwise result. The main aspect of the procedure is to split the
   equations into two parts, (I) a part that is a set of simple scalar
   equations of convective-diffusion type for which it is well known that
   the characteristic Galerkin procedure yields an optimal solution; and
   (2) the part where the equations are self-adjoint and therefore
   discretized optimally by the Galerkin procedure. It is possible to solve
   both the first and second parts of the system explicitly, retaining
   there the time step limitations of the Taylor-Galerkin procedure. But it
   is also possible to use semi-implicit processes where in the first part
   we use a much bigger time step generally governed by the Peclet number
   of the system while the second part is solved implicitly and is
   unconditionally stable. It turns out that the characteristic-based-split
   (CBS) process allows equal interpolation to be used for all system
   variables without difficulties when the incompressible or nearly
   incompressible stage is reached. It is hoped that the paper will help to
   make the algorithm more widely available and understood by the
   profession and that its advantages can be widely realised. Copyright (C)

   deformations in impact, or with some modification for metal forming,
   suffer two serious limitations.
   First, only quadrilateral or hexahedral linear elements can be used thus
   limiting the possibilities of adaptive refinement and adaptive meshing.
   Second, even with the use of such elements, special devices such as
   reduced integration must be introduced to avoid locking and reduce
   costs. These necessitate complex hour glass control, mending-type
   procedures.
   The main difficulties are those due to the need of treatment of (almost)
   incompressible deformation modes. Recently, similar difficulties have
   been overcome in the context of fluid dynamics(4,5) and soil
   dynamics(18-20) and we show here how the processes introduced there can
   be adopted effectively to the present problem, thus allowing an almost
   unrestricted choice of element interpolations. (C) 1998 John Wiley \&

   semi-implicit version of a fractional step finite element method for
   compressible flows that we have developed recently. The first is the
   imposition of boundary conditions, We show that no boundary conditions
   at all need to be imposed in the first step where an intermediate
   momentum is computed. This allows us to impose the real boundary
   conditions for the pressure, a point that turns out to be very important
   for compressible flows.
   The main difficulty of the semi-implicit form of the scheme arises in
   the solution of the continuity equation, since it involves both the
   density and the pressure. These two variables can be related through the
   equation of state, which in turn introduces the temperature as a
   variable in many cases. We discuss here the choice of variables
   (pressure or density) and some strategies to solve the continuity
   equation.
   The final point that we study is the behaviour of the scheme in the
   incompressible limit. It is shown that the method has an inherent
   pressure dissipation that allows us to reach this limit without having
   to satisfy the classical compatibility conditions for the interpolation
   of the velocity and the pressure. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   of new stresses on the patch and consequently to answers satisfying the

  abstract             = {{Many finite elements exhibit the so-called `volumetric locking' in the
   analysis of incompressible or quasi-incompressible problems. In this
   paper, a new approach is taken to overcome this undesirable effect. The
   starting point is a new setting of the governing differential equations
   using a finite calculus (FIC) formulation. The basis of the FIC method
   is the satisfaction of the standard equations for balance of momentum
   (equilibrium of forces) and mass conservation in a domain of finite size
   and retaining higher order terms in the Taylor expansions used to
   express the different terms of the differential equations over the
   balance domain. The modified differential equations contain additional
   terms which introduce the necessary stability in the equations to
   overcome the volumetric locking problem. The FIC approach has been
   successfully used for deriving stabilized finite element and meshless
   methods for a wide range of advective-diffusive and fluid flow problems.
   The same ideas are applied in this paper to derive a stabilized
   formulation for static and dynamic finite element analysis of
   incompressible solids using linear triangles and tetrahedra. Examples of
   application of the new stabilized formulation to linear static problems
   as well as to the semi-implicit and explicit 2D and 3D non-linear
   transient dynamic analysis of an impact problem and a bulk forming

   procedures for compressible and incompressible how problems. Many tests
   have been carried out with different error indicators for different
   problems. These refinement procedures show that the interpolation error
   indicators are adequate to predict an accurate solution. Comparison
   between the gradient and curvature-based error indicators show that the
   former yields better performance in most situations. However, we found
   that the latter indicators predict better motion in the recirculatory
   and unstable regions, than the gradient-based method. Many test cases
   have been presented for both compressible and incompressible flow
   problems. In the later part of the paper, we suggest a simple way of
   combining the curvature/gradient indicators of different key variables
   and present an appropriate problem where it is applicable. A wide
   coverage of relevant literature has also been presented in this paper.

  abstract  = {{The patch test was introduced in the mid-1960s, first as a check of
   satisfactory performance for elements violating continuity requirements,
   and later simply as a necessary condition which all elements had to
   satisfy and which frequently checked simple programming errors. In its
   original farm the patch test simply verified that the minimum local
   consistency error was achievable and that the programming was correct.
   Later, it was established that the test could also be used to find the
   convergence order of any finite element type.
   While consistency is one of the necessary requirements for convergence
   the second is of course that of stability. In the original early work
   only displacement type, structural elements were involved and thus
   stability was ensured by rejecting elements which could farm mechanisms.
   In a 1986 reformulation of the patch test, this stability (or
   solvability) requirement was formalized to all element assemblies and
   the patch test extended to become a generally applicable sufficient and
   necessary condition for convergence of all element forms {[}1,2].
   Although some misinterpretation of the patch test has occurred in
   literature {[}3,4], the authors believe that with certain restrictions
   on regularity of the problem dealt with, the satisfaction of. the patch
   rest is equivalent to the satisfaction of the more mathematical
   Babuska-Brezzi criteria {[}5,6].
   In recent years another important use of the patch test has been found
   by Babuska and his coworkers {[}7-9]. This work tests the asymptotic
   effectivity of various error estimating procedures used with various
   element patterns.}},

   incompressible behaviour for meaningful results whenever the plastic
   flow rule is isochoric. Most of the classical elements based on
   displacement formulations present problems to a greater or lesser extent
   when obtaining limit loads and failure mechanisms. Mixed
   pressure-displacement formulations are a suitable alternative, but not
   every combination of interpolation functions for pressures and
   displacements is allowed, since they have to satisfy Babuska-Brezzi
   conditions or pass a patch test for convergence. This excludes
   interpolations of the same order for both fields unless special
   techniques are used. This paper describes the formulation of mixed
   displacement-pressure elements with the same order of interpolation, and
   presents application to elastic and contained viscoplastic failure
   problems. It is shown how such different elements, like the T3P3 (linear
   displacements and pressures triangle) or the T6P6 (quadratic triangle in
   both variables), avoid volumetric locking and circumvent above mentioned
   restrictions. Indeed the formulation allows arbitrary interpolations as
   all restrictions are removed. However, the proposed formulation does not
   improve other aspects of element behaviour such as bending, and,
   therefore, the linear triangle is not recommended. Finally, performance
   of the quadratic T6P6 triangle is assessed using boundary value problems
   for which analytical solutions are available. Robustness against
   distortion is checked, and a good overall performance of this element is
   found. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

   upper bound property requires the recovered solution to be both

   locally (patch-by-patch) and the continuity is enforced by a
   postprocessing based on the partition of the unity concept. This
   postprocess is expected to preserve the features of the locally
   equilibrated stress field. Nevertheless, the postprocess phase modifies
   the equilibrium, which is no longer exactly fulfilled. A new methodology
   is introduced that yields upper bound estimates by taking into account
   this lack of equilibrium. This requires computing the L-2 norm of the
   error or relating it with the energy norm.
   The guaranteed upper bounds are obtained by using a pessimistic bound of
   the error L-2 norm, derived from an eigenvalue problem. Nevertheless,
   these bounds are not sharp. An additional strategy based on a more
   accurate assessment of the error L-2 norm is introduced, providing sharp
   estimates, which are practical upper bounds as it is demonstrated in the
   numerical tests. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   for simulation of metal forming processes. Because of their
   computational efficiency, finite element programs based on the explicit
   dynamic formulation proved to be a very attractive tool for the
   simulation of metal forming processes. The use of explicit programs in
   the sheet forming simulation is quite common, the possibilities of these
   codes in bulk forming simulation in our opinion are still not exploited
   sufficiently. In our paper, we will consider aspects of bulk forming
   simulation.
   We will present new formulations and algorithms developed for bulk metal
   forming within the explicit formulation. An extension of a finite
   element code for the thermomechanical coupled analysis is discussed. A
   new thermomechanical constitutive model developed by the authors and
   implemented in the program is presented.
   A new formulation based on the so-called split algorithm allows us to
   use linear triangular and tetrahedral elements in the analysis of large
   plastic deformations characteristic to forming processes. Linear
   triangles and tetrahedra have many advantages over quadrilateral and
   hexahedral elements. Linear triangles and tetrahedra based on the
   standard formulations exhibit volumetric locking and are not suitable
   for large plastic strain simulation. The new formulation allows to
   overcome this difficulty.
   New formulations and algorithms have been implemented in the finite
   element code Stampack developed at the International Centre for
   Numerical Methods in Engineering in Barcelona. Numerical examples
   illustrate some of the possibilities of the finite element code
   developed and validate new algorithms. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract     = {{Computational Mechanics or Computational Applied Science is today the
   base on which most of the achievements of engineering and physics are
   built.  Its concern is the solution of complex mathematical theories in
   numerical terms, without which the translation of these into practical
   artifacts would be impossible.  Indeed, by providing such quantitative
   measures it enhances the understanding of the physical phenomena and
   stimulates further development of theory and physical experiment.
   Most of the theory underlying physical phenomena is cast in terms of,
   often involved, differential equations for which closed forms of
   solution are seldom possible.  Numerical approximation or discretization
   processes are necessary for quantitative solution.  Here the first steps
   were taken at the start of this century by the pioneering work of
   Richardson introducing finite difference approximations.  The invention
   of relaxation methods by Southwell during the Second World War allowed
   many practical solutions to be achieved.  However, it was the advent of
   the electronic digital computer that marked the turning point in
   Computational Mechanics.  The dramatic escalation of the power of these
   machines, which still continues today, allowed the development of the
   field of Computational Mechanics as we know it.
   It is through this computer power that such methods of approximations as
   finite elements, finite differences, boundary solutions and spectral
   processes became a practical reality, though each was anticipated in the
   pre computer area.  It is not surprising therefore, that the
   mathematical foundations and the full development of such methods have
   been accomplished only relatively recently.
   Today we see the field of activity subdivided between those specializing
   in the development of the various computational approximation processes
   and those seeking optimal numerical solutions for their particular field
   of application.  It is the objective of this Congress and indeed of the
   International Association of Computational Mechanics to provide a forum
   at which an interdisciplinary exchange of information can take place
   between the various sections and disciplines of the whole field. 
   Indeed, this is the way progress can best be achieved.  Recent history
   indicates that substantial advances are as frequently made due to a
   method seeking a new application as through a problem requiring a
   solution.
   In recent history we have seen on occasion a liaison of a particular
   computational approximation method to a field of application occurring
   through historical accident.  Here the intimate association of the
   finite method and the field of SOLID MECHANICS (CSM or Computational
   Solid Mechanics) and that of the finite differences with FLUID DYNAMICS
   (CDF or Computational Fluid Dynamics) can be observed as classical
   examples.  Today the advent of new application fields and a better
   understanding of the approximation theory are helping to break down the
   barriers and ensure a more rational matching of objectives and methods. 
   We shall illustrate the lecture with examples of such recent progress
   and state some possibilities as yet unexplored.  Indeed, we are sure
   that the Congress will achieve in much more detail the same aims.
   This presentation stresses the essential unity of the subject and
   discuss some areas where progress and research are currently active. 
   Two of such, adaptive error controlled analysis and treatment of
   hyperbolic (fluid) problems, are singled out due to their wide
   applications.}},

   biquadratic quadrilateral elements refinement strategies of both mesh
   enrichment and mesh regeneration can lead to a prescribed accuracy being
   achieved by the Zienkiewicz-Zhu adaptive procedure1 with the optimal
   rate of convergence. However, fewer mesh refinement steps are needed if
   the strategy of mesh regeneration is employed with the newly developed
   automatic quadrilateral element mesh generator.2}},

  abstract  = {{Dynamic analysis of J'(2) solids typically involves a huge number of
   degrees of freedom. Therefore, use of low cost elements such as linear
   triangles and tetrahedrals, is almost a requisite. However, the accuracy
   of these elements greatly deteriorates due to the incompressible
   behaviour of the material encountered in this type of problems. Besides,
   using mixed velocity-pressure formulations is precluded for these
   elements by the Babuska-Brezzi condition unless especial stabilization
   techniques are incorporated. This paper presents a stabilization
   technique allowing equal order of interpolation based on the operator
   splitting formulation used in the field of Fluid Dynamics with strong
   emphasis in the adequate treatment of the boundary conditions. The paper
   also describes its application to the solution of strain localization
   problems in J'(2) rate dependent materials. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

  abstract  = {{In this paper a study is performed on application of two recovery
   methods, i.e. superconvergent patch recovery (SPR) and the recovery by
   equilibrium of patches (REP), to plate problems. The two recovery
   methods have been recognized to give similar results in adaptive
   solutions of two dimensional stress problems. While the former applies a
   least square fit over a set of values at the so called superconvergent
   points, the latter does not need any knowledge of such points and thus
   has a wider application especially in non-linear problems. The
   formulation of REP is extended to Reissner-Mindlin plate problems. The
   convergence rates of the recovered fields of the gradients obtained from
   application of the two methods are compared using series of regular
   triangular and rectangular meshes for thick and thin plate solution
   cases. Assumed strain formulation based elements, i.e. the elements
   formulated by mixed interpolation of tensorial components, as well as
   conventional from of elements based on selective integration schemes are
   employed for the study.
   In order to investigate the possibility of any improvement in the
   results by adding equilibrium constraints to SPR, as some authors
   suggest for simple two-dimensional problems, some weighted forms of such
   conditions are designed and added to the formulation. Comprehensive
   study has been given first by varying the weight terms to obtain the
   best enhanced results and then using the optimal values to investigate
   the effects of the constraints on the rate of convergence. It is
   observed that despite of the cost of this approach, due to the coupling
   of the gradient terms, no significant improvement is achieved. Copyright

   of skeleton displacements ( or velocities) and pore pressures.
   This mixed problem is similar to others found in solid and fluid
   dynamics. In the limit case of zero permeability and incompressibility
   of the fluid phase, the restrictions on the shape functions used to
   approximate displacements and pressures imposed by Babuska-Brezzi
   conditions or the Zienkiewicz-Taylor patch test hold.
   As a consequence, it is not possible to use directly elements with the
   same order of interpolation for the field variables.
   This paper proposes two alternative methods allowing us to circumvent
   the BE restrictions in the incompressibility limit, making it possible
   to use elements with the same order of interpolation. The first consists
   on introducing the divergence of the momentum equation of the mixture as
   an stabilization term, the second is a generalization of the two
   step-projection method introduced by Chorin for fluid dynamics problems.}},

   second-order time accurate, unconditionally stable, zero-order
   overshooting behavior, and features with controllable numerical
   dissipation and dispersion via a family of algorithms for effectively
   solving transient first-order systems. The key feature is the
   incorporation of a spurious root to introduce controllable numerical
   dissipation while preserving second-order accuracy (order-preserving
   feature) resulting in a two-root system, namely, the principal root (18)
   and a spurious root (28). In contrast to the classical Trapezoidal
   family of algorithms which are the most popular, the present framework
   has the same order of computational complexity, but a higher payoff that
   is a significant advance to the field for tackling a wide class of
   applications dealing with first-order transient systems. We also present
   the special case with selection of 18 = 1 and any 28 leading to the
   design of a family of generalized single-step single-solve {[}GS4-1]

   the Midpoint Rule at the other end (28 = 0) and anything in between, all

   CrankNicolson method. More interestingly, with the particular choice of
   18 = 28 = 0, the developed framework additionally inherits L-stable

   articulate the importance and notion of design spaces and algorithmic
   measures that not only can provide new avenues for improved algorithms
   by design, but also can distinguish in general, the quality of
   computational algorithms for time-dependent problems; the particular
   emphasis is on structural dynamics applications for the purpose of
   illustration and demonstration of the basic concepts (the underlying
   concepts can be extended to other disciplines as well). For further
   developments in time discretized operators and/or for evaluating
   existing methods, from the established measures for computational
   algorithms, the conclusion that the most effective (in the sense of
   convergence, namely, the stability and accuracy, and complexity, namely,
   the algorithmic formulation and algorithmic structure) computational
   algorithm should appear in a certain algorithmic structure of the design
   space amongst comparable algorithms is drawn. With this conclusion, and
   also with the notion of providing new avenues leading to improved
   algorithms by design, as an illustration, a novel computational
   algorithm which departs from the traditional paradigm (in the sense of
   LMS methods with which we are mostly familiar with and widely used in
   commercial software) is particularly designed into the perspective
   design space representation of comparable algorithms, and is termed here
   as the forward displacement non-linearly explicit L-stable (FDEL)
   algorithm which is unconditionally consistent and does not require
   non-linear iterations within each time step. From the established
   measures for comparable algorithms, simply for illustration purposes,
   the resulting design of the FDEL formulation is then compared with the
   commonly advocated explicit central difference method and the implicit
   Newmark average acceleration method (alternately, the same conclusion
   holds true against controllable numerically dissipative al gorithms)
   which pertain to the class of linear multi-step (LMS) methods for
   assessing both linear and non-linear dynamic cases. The conclusions that
   the proposed new design of the FDEL algorithm which is a direct
   consequence of the present notion of design spaces and measures, is the
   most effective algorithm to-date to our knowledge in comparison to the
   class of second-order accurate algorithms pertaining to LMS methods for
   routine and general non-linear dynamic situations is finally drawn

  abstract  = {For large-scale problems and large processor counts, the accuracy and
   efficiency with reduced solution times and attaining optimal parallel
   scalability of the entire transient duration of the simulation for
   general non-linear structural dynamics problems poses many computational
   challenges. For transient analysis, explicit time operators readily
   inherit algorithmic scalability and consequently enable parallel
   scalability. However, the key issues concerning parallel simulations via
   implicit time operators within the framework and encompassing the class
   of linear multistep methods include the totality of the following
   considerations to foster the proposed notion of A-scalability: (a)
   selection of robust scalable optimal time discretized operators that
   foster stabilized non-linear dynamic implicit computations both in terms
   of convergence and the number of non-linear iterations for completion of
   large-scale analysis of the highly non-linear dynamic responses, (b)
   selecting an appropriate scalable spatial domain decomposition method
   for solving the resulting linearized system of equations during the
   implicit phase of the nonlinear computations, (c) scalable
   implementation models and solver technology for the interface and coarse
   problems for attaining parallel scalability of the computations, and (d)
   scalable parallel graph partitioning techniques. These latter issues
   related to parallel implicit formulations are of interest and focus in
   this paper. The former involving parallel explicit formulations are also
   a natural subset of the present framework and have been addressed
   previously in Reference I (Advances in Engineering Software 2000;
   31:639-647). In the present context, of the key issues, although a
   particular aspect or a solver as related to the spatial domain
   decomposition may be designed to be numerically scalable, the totality
   of the aforementioned issues simultaneously play an important and
   integral role to attain A-scalability of the parallel formulations for
   the entire transient duration of the simulation and is desirable for
   transient problems. As such, the theoretical developments of the
   parallel formulations are first detailed in Part I of this paper, and
   the subsequent practical applications and performance results of general
   non-linear structural dynamics problems are described in Part 2 of this
   paper to foster the proposed notion of A-scalability. Copyright (C) 2003

   a successive linearization of the Crank-Nicolson scheme, that is
   unconditionally stable, but requires solving non-linear equation at each
   time step. We applied our linearized scheme for the time integration of
   the challenging Cahn-Hilliard equation, modeling the phase separation in
   fluids. At each time step the resulting variational equation is solved
   using higher-order isogeometric finite element method, with B-spline
   basis functions. The method was implemented in the PETIGA framework
   interfaced via the PETSc toolkit. The GMRES iterative solver was
   utilized for the solution of a resulting linear system at every time
   step. We also apply a simple adaptivity rule, which increases the time
   step size when the number of GMRES iterations is lower than 30. We
   compared our method with a non-linear, two stage
   predictor-multicorrector scheme, utilizing a sophisticated step length
   adaptivity. We controlled the stability of our simulations by monitoring
   the Ginzburg-Landau free energy functional. The proposed integration
   scheme outperforms the two-stage competitor in terms of the execution

We developed the Sinc-Galerkin and Sinc-Collocation methods to approximate the nonlinear two-point BVPs. These method are tested on the test examples and compared with several existing methods. The demonstrated results show that both of the presented methods more or less have the same accuracy, but in comparison with the other existing methods are considerable accurate.},

  abstract = {The differential equation solver \{STRIDE\} is at present being modified to make it more convenient to use, especially for difficult and nonstandard problems. In particular, its possible use for delay differential equations is being taken into account in the design. What seems to be needed is a means of calculating approximate solution values outside a current step by interpolation from information generated when previous steps were being worked through. In a solver of conventional design, there is also needed a means of making this data from previous steps available to the subroutine which computes the right-hand side of the delay differential equation. In STRIDE, interpolation within a current step is carried out using an expansion in a modified form of Taylor series, in which Laguerre polynomials take the place of the usual powers of the offset from the beginning of the current step. This is inappropriate for later use in computing delays and part of the content of this paper deals with a transformation of the data to a more convenient form. The other main topic discussed will be the use of reverse communication to allow flexibility of usage and to allow the extension to delay problems particularly straightforward. },

In particular, they have stability properties as for Runge-Kutta methods and it is easy to start the methods and to change stepsize. Because of the high stage order, continuous output is easier to achieve than for Runge-Kutta methods and this gives them a potential for the solution of delay problems as well as for ordinary differential equations. These new methods will be known as “ARK” or “Almost Runge-Kutta” methods. Even though they exist for orders at least as high as 6, we will concentrate here on methods of order 4, for which we present four sample methods.

The approach to the solution of these equations, and hence the construction of suitable methods, that we will describe in this paper, is based on computation of the coefficients of the stability polynomial by a variant of the Fourier series method and solving the resulting systems of polynomial equations by least squares minimization. Examples of explicit and implicit methods of order 5 and 6 are given which are appropriate for nonstiff or stiff differential systems in a sequential computing environment. The coefficients of these methods were obtained numerically with the aid of lmdif. f and lmder. f from MINPACK. These programs minimize the sum of the squares of nonlinear functions by a modification of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. The derived explicit and implicit methods have the same stability properties as explicit Runge-Kutta and \{SDIRK\} methods, respectively, of the same order. },

We assume that the stage order and the effective order are equal to s. Because \{ESIRK\} methods are generalizations of \{SIRK\} methods for which the abscissae can be chosen as any set of s distinct numbers, it might be expected that they will have serious disadvantages compared with the standard \{SIRK\} methods. In particular, changing stepsize is more complicated for the new methods, and it might be thought that difficulties arise for this aspect of the methods. However, it is found that from the point of view of truncation error, the standard \{SIRK\} choice need not be the best choice. Furthermore, there does not seem to be an overwhelming advantage in adopting the standard choice from the point of view of stability. },

The first reasons lie in the impetus that was given to the subject in the concluding years of the previous century by the seminal papers of Bashforth and Adams for linear multistep methods and Runge for Runge–Kutta methods. Other reasons, which of course apply to numerical analysis in general, are in the invention of electronic computers half way through the century and the needs in mathematical modelling of efficient numerical algorithms as an alternative to classical methods of applied mathematics. This survey paper follows many of the main strands in the developments of these methods, both for general problems, stiff systems, and for many of the special problem types that have been gaining in significance as the century draws to an end. },

  abstract  = {The ‘model-based’ algorithms available in the literature are primarily developed for the direct integration of the equations of motion for hybrid simulation in earthquake engineering, an experimental method where the system response is simulated by dividing it into a physical and an analytical domain. The term ‘model-based’ indicates that the algorithmic parameters are functions of the complete model of the system to enable unconditional stability to be achieved within the framework of an explicit formulation. These two features make the model-based algorithms also potential candidates for computations in structural dynamics. Based on the algorithmic difference equations, these algorithms can be classified as either explicit or semi-explicit, where the former refers to the algorithms with explicit difference equations for both displacement and velocity, while the latter for displacement only. The algorithms pertaining to each class are reviewed, and a new family of second-order unconditionally stable parametrically dissipative semi-explicit algorithms is presented. Numerical characteristics of these two classes of algorithms are assessed under linear and nonlinear structural behavior. Representative numerical examples are presented to complement the analytical findings. The analysis and numerical examples demonstrate the advantages and limitations of these two classes of model-based algorithms for applications in structural dynamics.

Accuracy and stability properties of the proposed algorithms are analysed theoretically and verified numerically. Certain subfamilies are found to be unconditionally stable for any system state (linear elastic, stiffness softening or stiffness hardening) that may occur in earthquake engineering of a practical structure.

This permits more flexibility in the design of time integration algorithms. As an example, we present an algorithm that has greater accuracy than several other dissipative algorithms even though for all frequencies its spurious root is non-zero.

It is shown that the algorithms are unconditionally stable for linear elastic and stiffness softening-type nonlinear systems, where the latter indicates a reduction in post yield stiffness in the force–deformation response. The amount of numerical damping is controlled by a single parameter, which provides a measure of the numerical energy dissipation at higher frequencies. Thus, for a specific value of this parameter, the resulting algorithm is shown to produce no numerical energy dissipation. Furthermore, it is shown that the influence of the numerical damping on the lower mode response is negligible. It is further shown that the numerical dispersion and energy dissipation characteristics of the proposed explicit algorithms are the same as that of the implicit generalized- α method. A numerical example is presented to demonstrate the potential of the proposed algorithms in reducing participation of undesired higher modes by using numerical energy dissipation to damp out these modes.

  abstract  = {Time-integration methods for semidiscrete finite element equations of hyperbolic and parabolic– hyperbolic types are analysed in the frequency domain. The discrete-time transfer functions of six popular methods are derived, and subsequently the forced response characteristics of single modes are studied in the frequency domain. Three characteristic numbers are derived which eliminate the parameter dependence of the frequency responses. Frequency responses and L2-norms of the phase and magnitude errors are calculated, and comparisons are given of the methods. As shown; the frequency-domain analysis explains all time-domain properties of the methods, and gives more insight into the subject. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

It is shown that numerical properties of the proposed explicit method are exactly the same as those of the constant average acceleration method for linear elastic systems. However, for nonlinear systems, it has unconditional stability for an instantaneous stiffness softening system and conditional stability for an instantaneous stiffness hardening system. This conditional stability property is much better than that of the Newmark explicit method. Hence, the proposed explicit method is possible to have the most important property of unconditional stability for an implicit method. On the other hand, this method can be implemented as simply as an explicit method, and hence, possesses the most important property of explicit implementation for an explicit method. Apparently, the integration of these two most important properties of explicit and implicit methods will allow the proposed explicit method to be competitive with other integration methods for structural dynamics.},

  abstract = {In structural dynamics, integration algorithms are often used to obtain the solution of temporally discretized equations of motion at selected time steps. Various time integration algorithms have been developed in the time domain using different methods. In order for an integration algorithm to be reliable it must be stable and accurate. A discrete transfer function is used to study the properties of integration algorithms. A pole mapping rule from control theory in conjunction with a discrete transfer function is used to develop new integration algorithms for obtaining solutions to structural dynamics problems. A new explicit integration algorithm, called the CR (Chen and Ricles) algorithm, is subsequently developed based on the proposed method. The properties of the algorithm are investigated and compared with other well established algorithms such as the Newmark family of integration algorithms. By assigning proper stable poles to the discrete transfer function the newly developed CR explicit algorithm is unconditionally stable and has the same accuracy as the Newmark method with constant acceleration. In addition, the CR algorithm is based on expressions for displacement and velocity that are both explicit in form, making it an appealing integration algorithm for solving structural dynamics problems.},

The nonlinear algorithms have been developed by their linear counterparts using a Newton--Raphson iterative procedure to ensure dynamic equilibrium inside each time step. A literature review of the available time integration schemes used for nonlinear problems and the family of linear GSSSS algorithms are presented along with several commonly used time integration algorithms as special cases. Afterwards, the nonlinear schemes are formulated, and outlined in an explicit flowchart, which describes the nonlinear integration procedure in detail. The nonlinear family of algorithms is applied to six benchmark problems involving the dynamic response of SDOF systems with various stiffness and damping properties, as well as to a 3dof structure representing finite element systems containing rigid connections, penalty factors and other such types of constraints. It is shown that the schemes with Continuous Acceleration formulation (such as the HHT-a method) perform in general better than the others, even with a large time step, which leads to reduced computational effort for the estimation of the nonlinear dynamic response with relatively little loss of accuracy.},

  abstract  = {For computational dynamics problems, direct time integration and mode superposition are the most widely employed approaches. Of the two, direct time stepping methods have been quite popular in many commercial codes because of their various inherent advantages. However, for numerous engineering applications, mode superposition techniques continue to be the choice of many analysts, especially for linear systems and for long time responses. To date, much progress has been made in the development and understanding of direct time integration methods for computational dynamics problems encountered in engineering. Besides investigations encompassing accuracy and stability properties of these time integration schemes, the related developments include single step, multi-step, mixed and/or variable time integration features and the like. Unlike past practices customarily employed for computational dynamics, the present paper introduces a new VIrtual-Pulse (VIP) time integral methodology which offers several attractive and effective features. The proposed method possesses a unique solution methodology of its own, thus avoiding the need to employ any existing time stepping methods. The present paper primarily serves to lay down the fundamental developments towards establishing the theoretical basis via new perspectives for subsequent applications to general computational structural dynamics. However, for expository purposes, attention is confined only to linear structural dynamic systems in this paper; and Rayleigh damping is considered here, although non-Rayleigh damping can be readily permitted but is not described here. As a consequence, the characteristics of the methodology include: 1) an explicit unconditionally stable representation, 2) second-order accuracy, 3) much less algorithmic damping than direct time integration methods advocated in existing commercial codes; if an undamped system is considered, the algorithmic damping is zero, 4) the relative period error is zero, and 5) self-starting features.

In addition, the unconditional stability might be the most promising property of this algorithm in performing pseudodynamic tests. Furthermore, it can have the improved properties if using momentum equations of motion instead of force equations of motion for the step-by-step integration. These characteristics are thoroughly verified analytically and/or numerically. In addition, actual pseudodynamic tests are performed to confirm the superiority of this pseudodynamic algorithm.},

  abstract  = {It has been shown that the operator-splitting method (OSM) provides explicit and unconditionally stable solutions for quasi-static pseudo-dynamic substructure testing. However, the OSM provides only an explicit target displacement but not an explicit target velocity, so that it is essentially an implicit method for real-time substructure testing (RST) when the velocity-dependent restoring force is considered. This paper proposes a target velocity formulation based on the forward difference of the predicted displacements so as to render the OSM explicit for RST. The stability and accuracy of the resulting OSM-RST algorithm are investigated. It is shown that the OSM-RST is unconditionally stable so long as the non-linear stiffness and damping are of the softening type (i.e. the tangent stiffness and damping never exceed the initial values). The stability of the OSM-RST for structures with infinite tangent damping coefficient or stiffness is also proved, and the stability of the method for MDOF structures with a non-classical damping matrix is demonstrated by an energy criterion. The effects of actuator delay and compensation are analysed based on the bilinear approximation of the actuator step response. Experiments on damped SDOF and MDOF structures verify that the stability of the OSM-RST is preserved when the experimental substructure generates velocity-dependent reaction forces, whereas the stability of real-time substructure tests based on the central difference method is worsened by the damping of the specimen.

  abstract  = {Spurious high-frequency responses resulting from spatial discretization in time-step algorithms for structural dynamic analysis have long been an issue of concern in the framework of traditional finite difference methods. Such algorithms should be not only numerically dissipative in a controllable manner, but also unconditionally stable so that the time-step size can be governed solely by the accuracy requirement. In this article, the issue is considered in the framework of the second-order scheme of the precise integration method (PIM). Taking the Newmark-&beta; method as a reference, the performance and numerical behavior of the second-order PIM for elasto-dynamic impact-response problems are studied in detail. In this analysis, the differential quadrature method is used for spatial discretization. The effects of spatial discretization, numerical damping, and time step on solution accuracy are explored by analyzing longitudinal vibrations of a shock-excited rod with rectangular, half-triangular, and Heaviside step impact. Both the analysis and numerical tests show that under the framework of the PIM, the spatial discretization used here can provide a reasonable number of model types for any given error tolerance. In the analysis of dynamic response, an appropriate spatial discretization scheme for a given structure is usually required in order to obtain an accurate and meaningful numerical solution, especially for describing the fine details of traction responses with sharp changes. Under the framework of the PIM, the numerical damping that is often required in traditional integration schemes is found to be unnecessary, and there is no restriction on the size of time steps, because the PIM can usually produce results with machine-like precision and is an unconditionally stable explicit method. &copy;2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Implicit schemes, which solve such equations, are unconditionally stable and are thus widely used. Part of this stability is due to force filtering which is inherent to the implicit formulation and is referred to artificial damping. We extract this artificial damping and we analyse frequencies. This analysis enables us to define a non arbitrary damping value and a stability criterion in accordance to filtering. This directly comes from a decrease of velocity vectors' eigenvalues resulting in an increase of the time step in the same proportion. Moreover we applied a simple filtering model reproducing artificial damping to explicit schemes and results reveal an increase of the time step. Implementation of this method is straightforward for existing physically based simulators. Applications to cloth and fish animations are presented. &copy; The Eurographics Association 2007.},

  abstract  = {A number of seismic hazard mitigation devices have been recently developed to enhance the seismic performance of structural systems. Many of these devices are load-rate dependent. The development of performance-based earthquake engineering procedures to effectively design structures with these devices requires that their behavior be well understood, accurate analytical models exist, and the design procedure be verified. These requirements can best be met by performing real-time hybrid tests of structural systems with these devices. The Real-Time Multi-Directional (RTMD) Earthquake Simulation NEES Equipment Site at Lehigh University specializes in real-time hybrid testing. This paper presents the development and application of an explicit integration algorithm for real-time testing at the RTMD facility. The algorithm is unconditionally stable for linear and nonlinear softening structures and developed using an innovative approach based on discrete control theory. This paper includes the development of the integration algorithm, its implementation into the real-time integrated control system at the RTMD facility, and its application to the real-time hybrid testing of passive elastomeric dampers.

The algorithm becomes unstable whatever the time integration interval, i.e., unconditionally unstable, when the mass of specimen equal or greater than that of its numerical counterpart. For the case of dynamic specimen, the algorithm is unconditionally unstable when there is no damping in the whole test structure; a damping will make the algorithm stable conditionally.

The PAC method uses the predicted acceleration vector and the updated stiffness matrix of the tested structure to compute the fully-explicit response values. The stability and accuracy characteristics of the PAC method are explored using frequency analysis. It is shown that the PAC method is unconditionally stable when the estimated tangent stiffness used in the algorithm is larger than or equal to the real stiffness of the tested structure. The PAC method is also shown to have desirable numerical damping characteristics due to the &alpha; parameter introduced in the corrector. The method provides adequate dissipation in the higher modes while guaranteeing that the lower modes are not affected too strongly. Using a linearly elastic single degree-of-freedom model, the PAC method is demonstrated to be able to damp undesired spurious oscillations and limit the amplification of actuator control errors. The performance of the PAC method for hybrid simulation is numerically demonstrated using a steel bridge model. It is shown that this method is capable of simulating the seismic response of the bridge model with reasonable accuracy despite the presence of material nonlinearity and displacement control errors during the process of numerical hybrid simulation. &copy; 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Spectral radius analysis of the amplification matrix shows that the EFC combined with the explicit Newmark-&beta; method has good numerical characteristics. Its stability limit of &Omega;=2 remains unchanged regardless of the system damping, because the velocity is perfectly achieved during simulation. Compared with the proposed method, the stability limits of the central difference method using direct velocity prediction and the EFC-average acceleration method with linear interpolation decrease with the increase of system damping. The unconditionally stable EFC-average acceleration method even comes to be conditionally stable. If an over-damped system with a damping ratio of 1.05 is considered, the stability limit is &Omega;=1.45. Finally, numerical simulation of single degree of freedom structure installed with magneto-rheological (MR) damper demonstrates that the proposed method is able to track both displacement and velocity commands accurately, thus having good applicability and accuracy for velocity-sensitive structures. &copy; 2016, Engineering Mechanics Press.

  abstract  = {An unconditionally stable, fully explicit and highly precise multiple timescale finite element modeling scheme is described for a fully coupled hydro-mechanical (FCHM) analysis of saturated poroelastic media. The finite element method (FEM) is used for the discretization of the FCHM differential equation in the space domain. Direct integration is performed based on the precise time step integration method (PTSIM) for the time derivatives. Two configurations for the proposed scheme are constructed (abbreviated as PTSIM-f1 and -f2, respectively). The stability and convergence of the PTSIM-f1 and -f2 are proved using a matrix-based spectral analysis in the time domain. It is demonstrated that the explicit scheme proposed in this paper is unconditionally stable and independent of the time-step size. The algorithmic error estimation results indicate that the numerical modeling performed using PTSIM-f1 and -f2 in the time domain match the computer precision. Theoretically, the algorithmic error is caused by only the mesh discretization. Therefore, the proposed modeling scheme is a semi-analytical scheme. The applicability and accuracy of the proposed scheme are examined using sample calculations. By comparing with the analytical solutions, it is indicated that the modeling results have significant advantages over the standard FEM in terms of precision and computational efficiency for large timescales. &copy; 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract  = {It seems that the explicit KR-&alpha; method (KRM) is promising for the step-by-step integration because it simultaneously integrates unconditional stability, explicit formulation, and numerical dissipation together. It was shown that KRM can inherit the numerical dispersion and energy dissipation properties of the generalized-&alpha; method (GM) for a linear elastic system, and it reduces to CR method (CRM) if &rho;<inf>&infin;</inf>=1is adopted, where &rho;<inf>&infin;</inf>is the spectral radius of the amplification matrix of KRM as the product of the natural frequency and the step size tends to infinity. However, two unusual properties were found for KRM and CRM, and they might limit their application to solve either linear elastic or nonlinear systems. One is the lack of capability to capture the structural nonlinearity, and the other is that it is unable to realistically reflect the dynamic loading. &copy; 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

Numerical properties of this family for linear elastic systems are exactly the same as those of the Newmark family method since they have the same characteristic equation. A subfamily of this family possesses unconditional stability for linear elastic systems. However, the most important aspects of this subfamily are the possibility of unconditional stability for nonlinear systems and second-order accuracy. The possibility of unconditional stability and second-order accuracy allows using a large time step; and the explicitness of each time step involves no iterative procedure. Hence, many computational efforts can be saved. },

   stable for linear elastic and any instantaneous stiffness softening
   systems based on linearized analysis whereas it is only conditionally
   stable for any instantaneous stiffness hardening system. In contrast to
   the previously published explicit method, the most important improvement
   of the new explicit method is that it can have unconditional stability
   for general instantaneous stiffness hardening, systems in addition to
   linear elastic and instantaneous stiffness softening systems. Since
   these stability results are obtained from a linearized stability
   analysis they are applicable to the non-linear systems that satisfied
   the simplifications used for the analysis. This explicit method is also
   shown to be second-order accurate. It is computationally efficient in
   the solution of a general structural dynamic problem, where the total
   response is dominated by low-frequency modes, when compared with
   explicit methods, such as the Newmark explicit method and the family of
   explicit methods developed by Tamma et al. (Comput. Methods Appl. Mech.

   the enhanced stability property and the efficiency in computing.

  abstract  = {Recent trends in hydrocarbon fuel research indicate that the number of species and reactions in chemical kinetic mechanisms is rapidly increasing in an effort to provide predictive capabilities for fuels of practical interest. In order to cope with the computational cost associated with the time integration of stiff, large chemical systems, a novel approach is proposed. The approach combines an exponential integrator and Krylov subspace approximations to the exponential function of the Jacobian matrix. The components of the approach are described in detail and applied to the ignition of stoichiometric methane-air and iso-octane-air mixtures, here described by two widely adopted chemical kinetic mechanisms. The approach is found to be robust even at relatively large time steps and the global error displays a nominal third-order convergence. The performance of the approach is improved by utilising an adaptive algorithm for the selection of the Krylov subspace size, which guarantees an approximation to the matrix exponential within user-defined error tolerance. The Krylov projection of the Jacobian matrix onto a low-dimensional space is interpreted as a local model reduction with a well-defined error control strategy. Finally, the performance of the approach is discussed with regard to the optimal selection of the parameters governing the accuracy of its individual components. &copy; 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

  abstract  = {The topic of this paper is solving the burnup equations using dedicated matrix exponential methods that are based on two different types of rational approximation near the negative real axis. The previously introduced Chebyshev Rational Approximation Method (CRAM) is now analyzed in detail for its accuracy and convergence, and correct partial fraction coefficients for approximation orders 14 and 16 are given to facilitate its implementation and improve the accuracy. As a new approach, rational approximation based on quadrature formulas derived from complex contour integrals is proposed, which forms an attractive alternative to CRAM, as its coefficients are easy to compute for any order of approximation. This gives the user the option to routinely choose between computational efficiency and accuracy all the way up to the level permitted by the available arithmetic precision. The presented results for two test cases are validated against reference solutions computed using high-precision arithmetics. The observed behavior of the methods confirms the previous conclusions of CRAM's excellent suitability for burnup calculations and establishes the quadrature-based approximation as a viable and flexible alternative that, like CRAM, has its foundation in the specific eigenvalue properties of burnup matrices.},

An interesting application of this method is the computation of the matrix exponential exp(-&tau;A)v. This vector plays an important role in the solution of parabolic equations where A results from some form of discretization of an elliptic operator. In the present paper we will argue that for these applications the convergence behavior of this method can be unsatisfactory. We will propose a modified method that resolves this by a simple preconditioned transformation at the cost of an inner-outer iteration. A priori error bounds are presented that are independent of the norm of A. This shows that the worst case convergence speed is independent of the mesh width in the spatial discretization of the elliptic operator. We discuss, furthermore, a posteriori error estimation and the tuning of the coupling between the inner and outer iteration. We conclude with several numerical experiments with the proposed method. &copy; 2006 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.},

As a side result, we obtain error bounds for Galerkin-type Krylov methods for linear equations, namely, the biconjugate gradient method and the full orthogonalization method. For Krylov approximations to matrix exponentials, we show superlinear error decay from relatively small iteration numbers onwards, depending on the geometry of the numerical range, the spectrum, or the pseudospectrum. The convergence to exp(&tau; A)v is faster than that of corresponding Krylov methods for the solution of linear equations (I -&tau;A)x = v, which usually arise in the numerical solution of stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We therefore propose a new class of time integration methods for large systems of nonlinear differential equations which use Krylov approximations to the exponential function of the Jacobian instead of solving linear or nonlinear systems of equations in every time step.},

Our approach is based on vector valued rational approximation where the approximants are determined by the denominator polynomials whose coefficients are obtained by solving an inexpensive linear least-squares problem. No matrix multiplications or divisions but matrix-vector products are required in the whole process. A technique of scaling and recurrence enables our method to be more effective when the problem is for fixed A,b and many values of t. We also give a backward error analysis in exact arithmetic for the truncation errors to derive our new algorithm. Preliminary numerical results illustrate that the new algorithm performs well. &copy; 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

For the case of three term orthogonalization recursions, simple error bounds are derived using the norm and the field of values of the projected operator. In addition, an a posteriori error estimate is given which in numerical examples is shown to work well for the approximation. In the numerical examples we particularly consider the case where the operator A arises from spatial discretization of an advection-diffusion operator.},

An appropriate structure preserving block method for approximating exp(A)V, where A is a large square real matrix and V a rectangular matrix, is given in Lopez and Simoncini (2006) [18].

In the burn-up calculations, the matrix exponential method has been widely used. In the present paper, we propose a new numerical solution of the matrix exponential, a Mini-Max Polynomial Approximation (MMPA) method. This method is numerically stable for burn-up matrices with extremely short half-lived nuclides as the Chebyshev Rational Approximation Method (CRAM), and it has several advantages over CRAM. We also propose a multi-step calculation, a computational time reduction scheme of the MMPA method, which can perform simultaneously burn-up calculations with several time periods. The applicability of these methods has been theoretically and numerically proved for general burn-up matrices. The numerical verification has been performed, and it has been shown that these methods have high precision equivalent to CRAM. &copy; 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We introduce an efficient variant that uses a much smaller squaring factor when ||A|| &raquo; 1 and a subdiagonal Pad&eacute; approximant of low degree, thereby significantly reducing the overall cost and avoiding the potential instability caused by overscaling, while giving forward error of the same magnitude as that of the standard algorithm. The new algorithm performs well if a rough estimate of the rightmost eigenvalue of A is available and the rightmost eigenvalues do not have widely varying imaginary parts, and it achieves significant speedup over the conventional algorithm especially when A is of large norm. Our algorithm uses the partial fraction form to evaluate the Pad&eacute; approximant, which makes it suitable for parallelization and directly applicable to computing the action of the matrix exponential exp(A)b, where b is a vector or a tall skinny matrix. For this problem the significantly smaller squaring factor has an even more pronounced benefit for efficiency when evaluating the action of the Pad&eacute; approximant. Copyright &copy; by SIAM.

  abstract  = {Krylov subspace methods have proved quite effective at approximating the action of a large sparse matrix exponential on a vector. Their numerical robustness and matrix-free nature have enabled them to make inroads into a variety of applications. A case in point is solving the chemical master equation (CME) in the context of modeling biochemical reactions in biological cells. This is a challenging problem that gives rise to an extremely large matrix due to the curse of dimensionality. Inexact Krylov subspace methods that build on truncation techniques have helped solve some CME models that were considered computationally out of reach as recently as a few years ago. However, as models grow, truncating them means using an even smaller fraction of their whole extent, thereby introducing more inexactness. But experimental evidence suggests an apparent success and the aim of this study is to give theoretical insights into the reasons why. Essentially, we show that the truncation can be put in the framework of inexact Krylov methods that relax matrix-vector products and compute them expediently by trading accuracy for speed. This allows us to analyze both the residual (or defect) and the error of the resulting approximations to the matrix exponential from the viewpoint of inexact Krylov methods. &copy; 2017 International Association for Mathematics and Computers in Simulation (IMACS).},

  abstract  = {As a time discretization scheme for an ordinary differential equation with a stiff linear term, there is a class of methods that utilize the exponential or related functions of the coefficient matrix of the linear term. To implement these methods, we must compute a set of matrix functions called "&phi;-function", that includes the exponential itself, and it is important to compute these functions efficiently and accurately. In this paper, we consider the modified scaling and squaring method for the computation of &phi;-function. An algorithm based on Higham's method is defined, and the bounding parameter &theta;<inf>m</inf> appropriate for &phi;-function is determined from an analysis of the truncation error under the assumption of the exact arithmetic. We also consider the propagation of the rounding error in the squaring process, and show that the error of &phi;-function is expected to be less than or roughly equal to that of the matrix exponential. Several evaluations are performed for famous test matrices, and the result shows that when the matrix exponential is computed accurately, the other &phi;-functions can also be obtained with the same level of accuracy. &copy; 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The algorithm computes an explicit parameterization of approximations of u(t, &#1013;) such that approximations for many different values of &#1013; and t can be obtained with a very small additional computational effort. The derivation of the algorithm is based on a reformulation of the parameterization as a linear parameter-free ordinary differential equation and on approximating the product of the matrix exponential and a vector with a Krylov method. The Krylov approximation is generated with Arnoldi's method and the structure of the coefficient matrix turns out to be independent of the truncation parameter so that it can also be interpreted as Arnoldi's method applied to an infinite dimensional matrix. We prove the super linear convergence of the algorithm and provide a posteriori error estimates to be used as termination criteria. The behavior of the algorithm is illustrated with examples stemming from spatial discretizations of partial differential equations. &copy; 2016 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.},

A convergence analysis is presented that provides insight into the role played by the processes of mollification and averaging in avoiding order reduction. A simple condition on the weight functions is shown to be both necessary and sufficient to avoid order reduction. &copy; 2008 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.},

However, a major drawback of the LL integrator is that its order of convergence is only two. The present paper overcomes this limitation by introducing a new class of numerical integrators, called the LLT method, that is based on the addition of a correction term to the LL approximation. In this way an arbitrary order of convergence can be achieved while retaining the dynamic properties of the LL method. In particular, it is proved that the LLT method reproduces correctly the phase portrait of a dynamical system near hyperbolic stationary points to the order of convergence. The performance of the introduced method is further illustrated through computer simulations. &copy; 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

To this end, more universal integration methods are considered in this paper: The so-called general linear methods which cover in particular linear multistep methods and Runge-Kutta methods. In order to establish a new theory for these integration methods, a network theoretical approach is used. A new class of Runge-Kutta methods will be derived. The generated algorithmic models inhere the same good properties as wave digital models but their numerical accuracy is increased. A simulation example for a nonlinear physical system will be given. },

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to analyze the relationships between four personality traits (calmness, trainability, dog sociability and boldness) of dogs (Canis familiaris) and dog and owner demographics on a large sample size with 14,004 individuals. German speaking dog owners could characterize their dog by filling out a form on the Internet. There were five demographic variables for dogs and nine for owners. Two statistical methods were used for investigating the associations between personality and demographic traits: the more traditional general linear methods and regression trees that are ideal for analyzing non-linear relationships in the structure of the data. The results showed that calmness is influenced primarily by the dog's age, the neutered status, the number of different types of professional training courses (e.g. obedience, agility) the dog had experienced and the age of acquisition. The least calm dogs were less than 2.5 years old, neutered and acquired after the first 12 weeks of age, while the calmest dogs were older than 6.9 years. Trainability was affected primarily by the training experiences, the dog's age, and the purpose of keeping the dog. The least trainable dogs had not received professional training at all and were older than 3 years. The most trainable dogs were those who participated in three or more types of professional training. Sociability toward conspecifics was mainly determined by the age, sex, training experience and time spent together. The least sociable dogs were older than 4.8 years and the owners spent less than 3 h with the dog daily. The most sociable dogs were less than 1.5 years old. Males were less sociable toward their conspecifics than females. Boldness was affected by the sex and age of the dog and the age of acquisition. The least bold were females acquired after the age of 1 year or bred by the owner. The boldest dogs were males, acquired before the age of 12 weeks, and were younger than 2 years old. Other variables, including the owner's gender, age, education, previous experience with dogs, the number of people and dogs in the household, and purpose of keeping the dogs had minor, but detectable effects. The results suggest that on-line questionnaires are a very effective means for collecting data about dog behavior, especially if owners are motivated by instant feedback. However, note that the characteristics of dogs in the present study were reported by the owners, and the associations with the traits do not necessarily represent a causal relationship. },

A characteristic feature of these new methods is that, although some of the data computed in a step has order limited to 2, this inaccuracy does not effect the order of the subsequent steps. Consequences of these assumptions are explored and this leads on to the derivation of some new methods of orders three and four. Preliminary numerical experiments are promising for some of these methods. },

Our investigation is addressed to providing the building blocks useful to analyze the linear stability properties of \{GLMs\} for second order ODEs: thus, we present the extension of the classical notions of stability matrix, stability polynomial, stability and periodicity interval, A -stability and P -stability to the family of GLMs. Special attention will be given to the derivation of highly stable GLMs, whose stability properties depend on the stability polynomial of indirect Runge–Kutta–Nyström methods based on Gauss–Legendre collocation points, which are known to be P -stable. In this way, we are able to provide P -stable \{GLMs\} whose order of convergence is greater than that of the corresponding \{RKN\} method, without heightening the computational cost. We finally provide and discuss examples of P -stable irreducible \{GLMs\} satisfying the mentioned features. },

  abstract = {Abstract This paper proposes an approach for high-order time integration within a multi-domain setting for time-fractional differential equations. Since the kernel is singular or nearly singular, two main difficulties arise after the domain decomposition: how to properly account for the history/memory part and how to perform the integration accurately. To address these issues, we propose a novel hybrid approach for the numerical integration based on the combination of three-term-recurrence relations of Jacobi polynomials and high-order Gauss quadrature.

Based on this, we propose a new multi-domain spectral method for high-order accurate time integrations and study its stability properties by identifying the method as a generalized linear method. Numerical experiments confirm hp-convergence for both time-fractional differential equations and time-fractional partial differential equations. },

The standard order conditions analysis involves the \{GL\} matrix itself and a starting procedure; however, a finishing method ( F ) is required to extract the actual \{ODE\} solution. The standard order analysis and stability are sufficient for the convergence of any \{GL\} method. Nonetheless, using a simple \{GL\} scheme, we show that the order definition may be too restrictive. Specifically, the order for \{GL\} methods with low order intermediate components may be underestimated. In this note we explore the order conditions for \{GL\} schemes and propose a new definition for characterizing the order of \{GL\} methods, which is focused on the final result–the outcome of F –and can provide more effective algebraic order conditions. },

  abstract = {Many orbit problems in celestial mechanics are described by (nonstiff) initial-value problems (IVPs) for second-order ordinary differential equations of the form y′′=f(y). The most successful integration methods are based on high-order Runge–Kutta–Nyström formulas. However, these methods were designed for sequential computer systems. In this paper, we consider high-order parallel methods that are not based on Runge–Kutta–Nyström formulas, but which fit into the class of general linear methods. In each step, these methods compute blocks of k approximate solution values (or stage values) at k different points using the whole previous block of solution values. The k stage values can be computed in parallel, so that on a k-processor computer system such methods effectively perform as a one-value method. The block methods considered in this paper are such that each equation defining a stage value resembles a linear multistep equation of the familiar Störmer–Cowell type. For k=4 and k=5 we constructed explicit \{PSC\} methods with stage order q=k and step point order p=k+1 and implicit \{PSC\} methods with q=k+1 and p=k+2. For k≥6 we can construct explicit \{PSC\} methods with q=k and p=k+2 and implicit \{PSC\} methods with q=k+1 and p=k+3. It turns out that for k≥5 the abscissae of the stage values can be chosen such that only k−1 stage values in each block have to be computed, so that the number of computational stages, and hence the number of processors and the number of starting values needed, reduces to k∗=k−1. The numerical examples reported in this paper show that the effective number of right-hand side evaluations required by a variable stepsize implementation of the 10th-order \{PSC\} method is 4 up to 30 times less than required by the Runge–Kutta–Nyström code \{DOPRIN\} (which is considered as one of the most efficient sequential codes for second-order ODEs). Furthermore, a comparison with the 12th-order parallel code \{PIRKN\} reveals that the \{PSC\} code is, in spite of its lower order, at least equally efficient, and in most cases more efficient than PIRKN. },

Differences between conditions were detected with the general linear method (factorial model). Barefoot running is characterized by a significantly larger external loading rate than the shod condition. The flatter foot placement at touchdown is prepared in free flight, implying an actively induced adaptation strategy. In the barefoot condition, plantar pressure measurements reveal a flatter foot placement to correlate with lower peak heel pressures. Therefore, it is assumed that runners adopt this different touchdown geometry in barefoot running in an attempt to limit the local pressure underneath the heel. A significantly higher leg stiffness during the stance phase was found for the barefoot condition. The sagittal kinematic adaptations between conditions were found in the same way for all subjects and at the three running velocities. However, large individual variations were observed between the runners for the rearfoot kinematics. },

The method adds the derivatives y ′ to y ( 6 ) , used in Taylor methods, to a 7-stage Runge–Kutta method of order 6. Forcing an expansion of the numerical solution to agree with a Taylor expansion of the true solution to order 11 leads to Taylor- and Runge–Kutta-type order conditions. These conditions are reorganized into Vandermonde-type linear systems whose solutions are the coefficients of the method. The new method has a larger scaled interval of absolute stability than the Dormand–Prince \{DP87\} and a larger unscaled interval of absolute stability than the Taylor method, T11, of order 11. HBT(11)7 is superior to \{DP87\} and \{T11\} in solving several problems often used to test higher-order \{ODE\} solvers on the basis of the number of steps, \{CPU\} time, and maximum global error. Numerical results show the benefit of adding high-order derivatives to Runge–Kutta methods. },

  abstract = {Locally multivariate approaches to functional brain mapping offer a highly appealing complement to conventional statistics, but require restrictive region-of-interest hypotheses, or, in exhaustive search forms (such as the “searchlight” algorithm; Kriegeskorte et al., 2006), are excessively computer intensive. We therefore propose a non-restrictive, comparatively fast yet highly sensitive method based on Monte Carlo approximation principles where locally multivariate maps are computed by averaging across voxelwise condition-discriminative information obtained from repeated stochastic sampling of fixed-size search volumes. On simulated data containing discriminative regions of varying size and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), the Monte Carlo method reduced the required computer resources by as much as 75% compared to the searchlight with no reduction in mapping performance. Notably, the Monte Carlo mapping approach not only outperformed the general linear method (GLM), but also produced higher discriminative voxel detection scores than the searchlight irrespective of classifier (linear or nonlinear support vector machine), discriminative region size or CNR. The improved performance was explained by the information-average procedure, and the Monte Carlo approach yielded mapping sensitivities of a few percent lower than an information-average exhaustive search. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the algorithm on whole-brain, multi-subject functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from a tactile study, revealing that the central representation of gentle touch is spatially distributed in somatosensory, insular and visual regions. },

Its formula uses y ′ , y ″ and y ‴ as in Obrechkoff methods. Forcing a Taylor expansion of the numerical solution to agree with an expansion of the true solution leads to multistep- and Runge–Kutta-type order conditions which are reorganized into linear Vandermonde-type systems. To reduce overhead, simple formulae are derived only once to obtain the values of Hermite–Birkhoff interpolation polynomials in terms of Lagrange basis functions for 16 quantized step size ratios. The step size is controlled by a local error estimator. When programmed in C ++, HBOQ(14)4 is superior to the Dormand–Prince Runge–Kutta pair DP(8,7)13M of order 8 in solving several problems often used to test higher order \{ODE\} solvers at stringent tolerances. When programmed in Matlab, it is superior to ode113 in solving costly problems, on the basis of the number of steps, \{CPU\} time, and maximum global error.

  abstract = {In the literature, various types of parallel methods for integrating nonstiff initial-value problems for first-order ordinary differential equation have been proposed. The greater part of them are based on an implicit multistage method in which the implicit relations are solved by the predictor-corrector (or fixed point iteration) method. In the predictor-corrector approach the computation of the components of the stage vector iterate can be distributed over s processors, where s is the number of implicit stages of the corrector method. However, the fact that after each iteration the processors have to exchange their just computed results is often mentioned as a drawback, because it implies frequent communication between the processors. Particularly on distributed memory computers, such a fine grain parallelism is not attractive. An alternative approach is based on implicit multistage methods which are such that the implicit stages are already parallel, so that they can be solved independently of each other. This means that only after completion of a step, the processors need to exchange their results. The purpose of this paper is the design of a class of parallel methods for solving nonstiff IVPs. We shall construct explicit methods of order k + 1 with k parallel stages where each stage equation is of Adams-Bashforth type and implicit methods of order k + 2 with k parallel stages which are of Adams-Moulton type. The abscissae in both families of methods are proved to be the Lobatto points, so that the Adams-Bashforth type method can be used as a predictor for the Adams-Moulton-type corrector. },

A method is presented that attempts to normalize the effects of water content and bulk density by using a covariate analysis to adjust the \{CI\} at each depth to a reference value of θ and Bd. This adjustment works as long as there is a relationship between \{CI\} vs. θ and Bd. A time-series analysis is used to eliminate the serial correlation of errors when separating treatments across depths. This is done by using a first- or second-order data transformation based on residuals and a general linear method of analysis, the parameter estimates obtained are unbiased and standard errors associated with these estimates are correct. },

This leads to general order conditions for many special cases of general linear methods such as diagonally implicit multistage integration methods, Nordsieck methods, and general linear methods with inherent Runge–Kutta stability. Exact coefficients for several low order methods with some desirable stability properties are presented for illustration. },

  abstract  = {It was recently shown in a series of papers that the frequency response of temporally discretized finite element equations and, consequently, the achievable accuracy cannot be manipulated independently in different frequency ranges. In addition, there exist limitations on the achievable accuracy of a time integration method no matter what the order of accuracy of the method is. Motivated by this fact, a family of time integration methods is derived in the time domain based on the principle that the exact solution of the semidiscrete equation of a system and the solution of the time integration method match at discrete time steps. It is necessary to pursue an exact match at discrete time steps, i.e. discrete equivalence, since the solutions of semidiscrete equations are obtained only at the time steps. Two time integration methods, that are exact at the time steps, are obtained based on the impulse and ramp response invariance principles. Numerical examples are presented to show the advantage of the proposed methods and to compare the performance of them with the performance of some popular methods.

By exploiting the dynamic filters for the B-spline trajectory planning, it has been possible to integrate the trajectory generation within a repetitive control scheme able to modify in real-time the reference signal with the aims of nullify interpolation errors. Experimental results obtained controlling two joints of a standard industrial manipulator are reported, showing the effectiveness of the proposed method. &copy; 2015 IEEE.},

  abstract  = {This paper utilizes a recursive formula for transformation matrices of B-spline bases to construct biorthogonal nonuniform B-spline wavelets based on discrete norm l<inf>2</inf> and proposes the reconstruction and decomposition algorithms for the MRA of the wavelets. The computation of reconstruction matrices of the proposed wavelets is based on simple recursion and integral operation is avoided. The reconstruction and decomposition algorithms are both simple, efficient and with linear time complexity. Moreover, the analysis for the performances of the proposed wavelets reveals that the wavelets possess smaller supports in general cases compared with that of semiorthogonal nonuniform B-spline wavelets, with good approximation property and suitable for any uniform and nonuniform nested sequences of knot vectors. Several examples are given for the applications of the proposed wavelets in the MRA of nonuniform B-spline curves. The experimental results show that as any other nonuniform B-spline wavelets, the proposed wavelets provide greater flexibility than uniform B-spline wavelets do for the applications of the MRA of B-spline curves and surfaces. With the proposed wavelets we can easily construct rich multiresolution levels and maintain the specified characteristic points as well as local details of the decomposed curves to satisfy various requirements in the applications. &copy; 2008 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract  = {Based on the separable wavelet theory, the scaling functions of one-dimensional B-spline wavelet on the interval (BSWI) is employed to construct the two-dimensional B-spline wavelet bases on the interval. In order to solve the GPR wave equation, these constructed wavelet bases are used as the interpolation functions, and a transformation matrix is introduced to convert between the wavelet coefficient space and the physical space (radar electromagnetic field). In this study, the discrete format of GPR wave equation for two-dimensional interval B-spline wavelet finite element is derived using Galerkin algorithm. And the integral values and the connection coefficients of the second order one-scale and second order two-scale BSWI functions are calculated. The detailed process of the algorithm is given. Then two typical examples are forward modeled using the BSWI method by Matlab program. The result shows that the BSWI with fewer units has the same precision as FEM. Increasing the scale of BSWI algorithm, the precision of the results is also improved, but it is time-consuming. Finally, the BSWI algorithm is applied to model bi-phase random concrete medium, and it proves that the random medium model theory can describe the practical distribution of concrete medium flexibly and effectively. Furthermore, this study found that the forward modeling profile is more accordant with practical profile, which demonstrates that medium model theory can simulate the transmission process of the radar wave more accurately. It also provides a theoretical basis for improving the detection results and interpretation accuracy of GPR. &copy; 2016, Science Press. All right reserved.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents an optimal and efficient path planner using adaptive B-spline approximation mechanism for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) operating in turbulent, cluttered and uncertain environments. The proposed method recursively inserts midpoint knots until an approximated B-Spline curve that satisfies the accuracy criteria is achieved. The method is able to adapt the quantity of internal knots inserted based on the specific needs of each path to conform to its respective desired smooth path and satisfy the accuracy criteria. Consequently, this method effectively minimizes the number of internal knots for any given trajectory, thus effectively improving the computation efficiency of the path fitness evaluation and hence path planning. The proposed method is integrated with a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based path planner and tested to generate an optimal trajectory for an AUV travelling through a turbulent ocean field in scenarios with uncertainty in position estimates. Simulation results show that the resulting approach is able to quickly and effectively guide the AUV to its destination with significant savings in computation time compared with B-Spline based planners with fixed numbers of internal nodes. &copy; 2012 IEEE.},

Numerical examples for inner and outer free-surface flows are shown. The accuracy of the numerical solution is assessed either by checking mass and energy conservation or by comparing with reference solutions. Good results are generally obtained.

  abstract  = {In this paper a novel algebraic real-time algorithm for implementation of sinusoidal pulse width modulation (SPWM) based on B-Spline carriers is introduced and discussed. B-Spline functions are used as carrier signals with the aim to to reduce harmonic content of the three phase inverter output voltage. This algorithm eliminates the problem of B-Spline recursive evaluation with convolution integrals or convolution sums in digital counterpart. The pulse pattern synthesis is made with the help pre-calculated duty cycle expressions. In this way the carrier signals have not to be really synthesized, hence the hardware and the whole inverter control system becomes cheaper, more reliable and affordable. The proposed control Algorithm effectiveness is finally verified by means of numerical simulations in different operating condition (e.g. for different values of the amplitude modulation index and for different values of the power factor) of a three phase inverter. Different values for voltage and current Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) are presented comparing the B-Spline SPWM control with the classical SPWM control with triangular carrier signal. &copy; 2008 IEEE.},

Numerical results are compared with each other and some former results by calculating discrete root mean square and maximum error norms in each case. A matrix stability analysis is also performed by determining eigenvalues of the coefficient matrices numerically.

  abstract  = {This article proposes a B-spline-decomposition-based approach to output tracking with preview for nonminimum-phase (NMP) systems. It has been shown that when there exists a finite (in time) preview of future desired trajectory, precision output tracking of NMP systems can be achieved by using the preview-based stable-inversion technique. The performance of this approach, however, can be sensitive to system dynamics uncertainty, and the computation involved can be demanding. We propose to address these challenges by integrating the notion of trajectory decomposition with the iterative learning control (ILC) technique. Particularly, the B-splines are used to construct a library of output elements and the corresponding input elements a priori, and the ILC techniques are used to obtain the input elements for precision tracking of the output elements. During the tracking with preview, the previewed future desired trajectory is decomposed by using the output elements, and the input is synthesized by using the corresponding input elements with chosen pre- and post-actuation times. The required pre-/post-actuation times are quantified based on the stable-inversion theory. The use of B-splines substantially reduces the number of output elements in the library, and the decomposition-synthesis occurs only at time instants separated by the difference between the preview time and pre-actuation time. The proposed approach is illustrated through a simulation study of nanomanipulation application using a NMP piezo actuator model. &copy; 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The collocation method is applied to discretize the integral equation and then solved for the unknown potentials and source strengths.

Results are obtained for regular and irregular waves and compared with available experimental and computational results. It is found that the results from the present method are in very good agreement with the published results, and in particular with experimental data.

The goal of this work was to develop an efficient and easy to use tool that allows the physician to partition a segmented organ into its segments or lobes.The proposed tool allows the user to define a cutting surface by drawing some traces on 2D sections of a 3D object, cut the object into two pieces with a smooth surface that fits the input traces, and iterate the process until the object is partitioned at the desired level. The tool is based on an algorithm that interpolates the user-defined traces with B-spline surface and computes a binary cutting volume that represents the different sides of the surface. The computation of the cutting volume is based on the multi-resolution triangulation of the B-spline surface.The proposed algorithm was integrated into an open-source medical image processing framework. Using the tool, the user can select the object to be partitioned (e.g. segmented liver), define the cutting surface based on the corresponding medical image (medical image visualizing the internal structure of the liver), cut the selected object, and iterate the process. In case of liver segment separation, the cuts can be performed according to a predefined sequence, which makes it possible to label the temporary as well as the final partitions (lobes, segments) automatically.The presented tool was evaluated for anatomical segment separation of the liver involving 14 cases and virtual liver tumor resection involving one case. The segment separation was repeated 3 different times by one physician for all cases, and the average and the standard deviation of segment volumes were computed. According to the test experiences the presented algorithm proved to be efficient and user-friendly enough to perform free form cuts for liver segment separation and virtual liver tumor resection. The volume quantification of segments showed good correlation with the prior art and the vessel-based liver segment separation, which demonstrate the clinical usability of the presented method. &copy; 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

We use the quadratic B-spline function as temporal basis functions, which permits both the induced currents and induced charges to be properly approximated in terms of completeness. Because the B-spline function has the least support width among all polynomial basis functions of the same order, the resulting system matrices seem to be the sparsest. The TDIE formulations using induced electric polarizations as unknown function are adopted and justified. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach is accurate and efficient, and no late-time instability is observed.},

  abstract  = {In this investigation, a numerical procedure for modeling sliding and nonsliding joint constraints for the B-spline thin plate element is developed for the large deformation analysis of multibody systems. A concept of intermediate reference coordinates proposed for the absolute nodal coordinate formulation is generalized for B-spline elements such that a wide variety of joint constraints can be modeled using existing joint constraint libraries already implemented in multibody dynamics codes. This procedure allows for modeling sliding joints for B-spline elements that requires a solution to moving boundary problems by introducing time-variant surface parameters in the B-spline parametric domain. Since surface parameters treated as knot variables in the basis function are defined in the entire parametric domain rather than the element domain, the location of the constraint definition point can be determined without knowing in which elements the sliding point is located. Furthermore, using the B-spline recurrence formula, control points used for describing the constraint equations can be systematically extracted. It is shown that many types of nonsliding joints fixed on the flexible body can also be modeled as a special case of the sliding joint formulation developed in this investigation, leading to a unified joint constraint formulation for B-spline elements. Several numerical examples are presented in order to demonstrate the use of the numerical procedure developed in this investigation. &copy; 2014 by ASME.},

Direct integration of reverse engineering and rapid prototyping is not a new issue and its importance has been demonstrated by many authors.

To resolve the difficult dilemma a new algorithm is developed to build a bridge between scattered points and adaptive slicing. &copy; 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The free-form feature family that is considered is that of extruded protrusions whose cross-section is a closed, periodic B-Spline curve. In this methodology, for machining a part with B-Spline protrusion located at the free end, the part is first rough turned to the maximum profile diameter of the B-Spline, followed by rough profile cutting and finish profiling with axially mounted end mill tools. The identification and sequencing of machining volumes is completely automated, as is the generation of actual NC code. The approach supports both convex and non-convex profiles. In the case of non-convex profiles, the process planning algorithm ensures that there is no gouging of the work piece by the tool. The algorithm also identifies when sections of the tool path lie outside the work piece and utilizes rapid traverses in these regions to reduce cutting time. This methodology presents an integrated turn-mill process planning where by making the process fully automated from design with no user intervention making the overall process planning efficient. The algorithm was tested on several examples and test parts using the unmodified NC code obtained from the implementation were run on a Moriseiki mill-turn center. The parts that were produced met the dimensional specifications of the desired part. &copy; 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract  = {B-spline collocation is a method for approximating solutions to differential equations. The method is based on using advanced geometric functions that have become the standard for use with solid modeling codes to represent complex curves and surfaces. B-spline collocation promises to be a faster method than traditional methods for two primary reasons. First, it is a meshless method, thus avoiding the need to generate a mesh, and second, it can represent a complex solution with far fewer data than traditional finite volume, finite difference methods, leading to smaller problem matrices that should be quicker to solve. The method also has the capacity to provide very accurate solutions. The scope of the present work has been to develop the necessary parts of solution algorithms to begin to determine how effective and efficient B-spline collocation is, and to apply the method to a simple fluid dynamic problem. The differential terms of the equation are computed analytically at any point to determine equation residuals. The points where residuals are evaluated are called collocation points. The necessary parts of the solution algorithm include the basic solution approach, definition of residuals, the collocation points, and scaling. Each of these issues is addressed leading to the attainment of reasonable solutions using multiple solution schemes. Although the solution algorithm cannot yet be considered to be optimal, the time needed for a solution is about half the time used by an optimized commercial code. Comparative results are reported for a simple fluid dynamics test problem.},

A novel feature of this package is that it employs high order, adaptive methods in both time and space, controlling and balancing both spatial and temporal error estimates. The software implements a spline collocation method at Gaussian points, with a B-spline basis, for the spatial discretization. The time integration is performed using a modification of the popular DAE solver, DASSL. Based on the computation of a second, higher order, global solution, a high quality a posteriori spatial error estimate is obtained after each successful time step. The spatial error is controlled by a sophisticated new mesh selection algorithm based on an equidistribution principle. In this article we describe the overall structure of the BACOL package, and in particular the modifications to the DASSL package that improve its performance within BACOL. An example is provided in the online Appendix to illustrate the use of the package.},

First, the spatial and temporal convergence of the proposed scheme is assessed by studying steady and unsteady flow past a fixed cylinder. Then, the scheme is applied to several benchmark problems to demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed scheme.

Design/methodology/approach - In the present method, any governing equations are discretized by B-spline approximation which is implemented in the spirit of FD technique using a local B-spline collocation scheme. The key aspect of the method is that any derivative is stated as neighbouring nodal values based on B-spline interpolants. The set of neighbouring nodes are allowed to be randomly distributed thus enhanced flexibility in the numerical simulation can be obtained. The method requires no mesh connectivity at all for either field variable approximation or integration. Time integration is performed by using the Crank-Nicolson implicit time stepping technique. Findings - Several heat conduction problems in complex domains which represent for extended surfaces in industrial applications are examined to demonstrate the effectiveness of the present approach. Comparison of the obtained results with solutions from other numerical method available in literature is given. Excellent agreement with reference numerical method has been found. Research limitations/implications - The method is presented for 2D problems. Nevertheless, it would be also applicable for 3D problems. Practical implications - A transient two dimensional heat conduction in complex domains which represent for extended surfaces in industrial applications is presented. Originality/value - The presented new meshless local method is simple and accurate, while it is also suitable for analysis in domains of arbitrary geometries. &copy; Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

In this paper, a novel high-performance architecture for the computation of uniform, nonuniform, rational, and nonrational B-Spline curves and surfaces is presented. This architecture has been derived through a sequence of steps. First, a systolic architecture for the computation of the basis function values, the basis function evaluation array (the BFEA), is developed. Using the BFEA as its core, an architecture for the computation of NURBS curves is constructed. This architecture is then extended to compute NURBS surfaces. Finally, this architecture is augmented to compute the surface normals, so that the output from this architecture can be directly used for rendering the NURBS surface. The overall linear structure of the architecture, its small I/O requirements, its nondependence on the size of the problem (in terms of the number of control points and the number of points on the curve/surface that have to be computed), and its very high throughput make this architecture highly suitable for integration into the standard graphics pipeline of high-end workstations. Results of the timing analysis indicate a potential throughput of one triangle with the normal vectors at its vertices, every two clock cycles.},

  abstract  = {The purpose of this article is to propose the design and implement an efficient and open real-time non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) interpolator for computerized numerical control (CNC) motion control. The proposed architecture of real-time NURBS interpolator integrates the advantages of digital differential analyser (DDA) and the native NURBS interpolator with the help of the data conversion module. First, the desired compensation positions are generated by NURBS interpolator concerning feedrate and curvature for manufacturing accuracy. A data conversion module is then applied to transform the position commands from float to integer. Using this integral-type position command, the pulse trains can be generated by DDA for the AC servomechanism in position mode. The simulation and experimental results validate that this novel real-time NURBS controller is effective and efficient enough to drive the general servomechanism without changing the control scheme of the traditional AC servomotor. &copy; IMechE 2007.},

  abstract  = {Real-time 3D echocardiography (RT3DE) is a non-invasive imaging modality used to provide diagnostic information about cardiac morphology and function. Unfortunately, manual analysis of these datasets remains cumbersome and time-consuming. Our team recently proposed a generic framework for automatic 3D segmentation of volumetric datasets (B-spline explicit active surfaces, BEAS). However, as fully automatic segmentation can (locally) fail, the option of manually correcting the segmentation result should be available for optimal clinical routine use. The aim of this study was to develop an interactive segmentation method by embedding the user input in the segmentation framework. In order to validate the proposed method, a database consisting of 10 3D echocardiographic images from open-chest sheep experiments was used. Two experts segmented the data, using a purely manual approach as well as the proposed interactive framework. Using the interactive approach, the RT3DE data could be analyzed in a more time efficient manner (analysis time, interactive: 44.7 &plusmn; 11.9s vs. manual: 181.5 &plusmn; 66.2s; p &lt; 0.001), while being an equally accurate alternative to manual contouring. Moreover, it improved the reproducibility of the extracted measurements (inter-observer variability, interactive: 3.1 &plusmn; 2.4ml vs. manual: 6.0 &plusmn; 2.7ml; p &lt; 0.05). &copy; 2012 IEEE.},

And it retains advantages of high-precision, small inputs, and strong continuity. In contrast to traditional FEM which employs the Gauss quadrature to gain results on Gauss points, the variables are gained on nodal points in the new spline FEM.

We introduce enrichment functions for the X-FEM to represent a crack geometry. In the WGM, low-resolution scaling functions are periodically located across the entire analysis domain to approximate deformations of a body. High-resolution wavelet functions and enrichment functions including crack tip singular fields are superposed on the scaling functions to represent the severe stress concentration around holes or crack tips. Heaviside functions are also enriched to treat the displacement discontinuity of the crack face. Multiresolution analysis of the wavelet basis functions plays an important role in the WGM. To simulate the transients, the wavelet Galerkin formulation is discretized using a Newmark-&beta; time integration scheme. A path independent J-integral is adopted to evaluate the dynamic stress intensity factor (DSIF). We solve dynamic stress concentration problems and evaluate DSIF of 2D cracked solids. The accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method are discussed through the numerical examples. &copy; 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract  = {The dynamic behaviour of wood machining processes affects the surface finish quality of machined workpieces. In order to meet the requirements of increased production efficiency and improved product quality, surface quality information is needed for enhanced process control. However, current methods using high price devices or sophisticated designs, may not be suitable for industrial real-time application. This paper presents a novel approach of surface quality evaluation by on-line vibration analysis using an adaptive spline wavelet algorithm, which is based on the excellent time-frequency localization of B-spline wavelets. A series of experiments have been performed to extract the feature, which is the correlation between the relevant frequency band(s) of vibration with the change of the amplitude and the surface quality. The graphs of the experimental results demonstrate that the change of the amplitude in the selective frequency bands with variable resolution (linear and non-linear) reflects the quality of surface finish, and the root sum square of wavelet power spectrum is a good indication of surface quality. Thus, surface quality can be estimated and quantified at an average level in real time. The results can be used to regulate and optimize the machine's feed speed, maintaining a constant spindle motor speed during cutting. This will lead to higher level control and machining rates while keeping dimensional integrity and surface finish within specification.},

We propose flexible high-accuracy practical techniques to perform 3D and 2D integral transformations from potential field components to potential and from potential-field gradient components to potential field components in the space domain using cubic B-splines. The spline techniques are applicable to either uniform or non-uniform rectangular grids for the 3D case, and applicable to either regular or irregular grids for the 2D case. The spline-based indefinite integrations can be computed at any point in the computational domain. In our synthetic 3D gravity and magnetic transformation examples, we show that the spline techniques are substantially more accurate than the Fourier transform techniques, and demonstrate that harmonicity is confirmed substantially better for the spline method than the Fourier transform method and that spline-based integration and differentiation are invertible. The cost of the increase in accuracy is an increase in computing time. Our real data examples of 3D transformations show that the spline-based results agree substantially better or better with the observed data than do the Fourier-based results. The spline techniques would therefore be very useful for data quality control through comparisons of the computed and observed components. If certain desired components of the potential field or gradient data are not measured, they can be obtained using the spline-based transformations as alternatives to the Fourier transform techniques. &copy; 2012 European Association of Geoscientists &amp; Engineers.},

  abstract  = {A fully coupled time-domain ship hydroelasticity problem focusing on a springing phenomenon is considered in this study using a hybrid boundary element method (BEM) finite element method (FEM) scheme. The fluid domain surrounding a flexible vessel is handled with a boundary element method adopting a higher-order B-spline Rankine panel method. The structural domain is modeled by a finite element method relying on the one-dimensional beam element, which is able to capture the coupling effect between torsion and bending as well as warping distortion. Coupling between the two subdomains is realized by the Newton method in which an exact Jacobian matrix is derived by solving both fluid and structure tangent problems. The calculation is repeated until the solution reaches convergence. Thanks to the positive aspects of this implicit scheme, numerical instability related to the time integration can be avoided without relying on infinite frequency added mass, which is inevitable when an explicit scheme is used. Moreover, a direct integration scheme, such as the Newmark-p method, for structural problems can be used, and this formulation can be easily extended to the case with structural nonlinear effect, such as large deformation. The developed computer program is validated through comparison with published experimental data, ending up with good correspondence between the two results. Validation is also achieved through a comparative study on rigid body motion with an existing six degrees of freedom (6-DOF) ship motion program.},

The approximation has been constructed previously for full-turn maps of large particle accelerators, and a large saving in time (for instance a factor of 60) has been demonstrated. A shortcoming of our work to date arises from the use of canonical polar coordinates, which preclude map construction in small regions of phase space near coordinate singularities. Here, we show that Cartesian coordinates can be used, thus avoiding singularities. The generator is represented in a basis of tensor product B-splines. Under weak conditions, the spline expansion converges uniformly as the mesh is refined, approaching the generator of the Poincare map as defined by the symplectic integrator, in some parallelepiped of phase space centered at the origin.},

  abstract  = {The quasi-steady resonant vibration of a flexible seagoing vessel under resonant wave excitation force, called springing, is studied in this paper. A higher-order B-spline Rankine panel method is used to represent the effects of the fluid motion surrounding this flexible seagoing vessel, and a finite element formulation based on Vlasov beam is employed for structural response. The boundary integral equation and finite element equation, both for fluid and structural domains, are fully coupled with each other using an iterative implicit method in the time domain. Coupling between the two field equations is achieved by relying on fixed-point iteration with relaxation aided by Aitken's &delta;<sup>2</sup> process to maximize convergence speed. The steady-unsteady coupling term or m-term in the linearized body boundary condition derived by Timman and Newman is taken into account for accurate prediction of flexible body motion when forward speed is present. The 2nd derivative of basis potential in the m-term is obtained by modifying Nakos approach, which was originally developed using the Stokes theorem for rigid body ship motion problem. For the solution of the FE equation, instead of conventionally used modal superposition method, a direct integration scheme based on Newmark method is employed. It is believed that this technique is more attractive in the sense that it allows us free from the selection of optimum number of mode-shapes in the computation. &copy; 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract  = {This paper presents a novel method for the edge-preserving smoothing of biomedical images. It is based on the convolution of the image with scaled B-splines. The size of the spline convolution kernel at each image position is adaptive and matched to the underlying image characteristics; i.e., wide splines for smooth regions and narrow ones for pixels belonging to edges. Consequently, the algorithm reduces image noise in homogeneous areas while, at the same time, preserving image structures such as edges or corners. We argue that the proposed adaptive filtering strategy provides a good balance between the improvement in the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and perceptual quality. Our algorithm takes advantage of the unique convolution and factorization properties of B-splines. Specifically, the input signal is expressed in a B-spline basis; the inner product with a B-spline of arbitrary size is then computed by using an adequate combination of ID integrations (preprocessing) and rescaled finite differences. The method is computationally efficient with a cost per pixel that is fixed and independent upon the scaling factor. &copy; 2007 Taylor &amp; Francis Group.},

Based an explicit, constructive, and analytical solution of the donating region, the author proposes algorithms of Lagrangian flux calculation (LFC) as algebraic quadratures over the spline-approximated donating regions. This generic formulation yields high accuracies up to the 8th-order both in time and space. As another benefit, LFC leads to a conservative semi-Lagrangian method whose time step size is free of the Eulerian stability constraint <inf>C r</inf> &le 1. The high accuracy and robustness of the proposed LFC algorithms are demonstrated by various numerical tests with Courant numbers ranging from 1 to 10,000 and with accuracies from the 2nd order to the 8th order. LFC might also be useful in designing hybrid Eulerian methods for complex geometries. &copy; 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Through casting the problem in a recursive framework using the value-iteration procedure, the value functions of every iteration step is approximated with a time-varying multivariate simplex B-spline on a certain state domain of interest. In the collocation scheme, the time-dependent coefficients of the spline function are further approximated with ordinary univariate B-splines to yield a discretization for the value function fully in terms of piece-wise polynomials. The B-spline coefficients are determined by solving a sequence of highly sparse quadratic programming problems. The proposed algorithm is demonstrated on a pair of benchmark example problems. Simulation results indicate that the method can yield increasingly more accurate approximations of the value function by refinement of the triangulation. &copy; 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract  = {In this work, we consider the problem of generating agile maneuver profiles for Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicles in 3D Complex environments. This problem is complicated by the fact that, generation of the dynamically and geometrically feasible flight trajectories for agile maneuver profiles requires search of nonlinear state space of the aircraft dynamics. This work suggests a two layer feasible trajectory/maneuver generation system. Integrated Path planning (considers geometrical, velocity and acceleration constraints) and maneuver generation (considers saturation envelope and attitude continuity constraints) system enables each layer to solve its own reduced order dimensional feasibility problem, thus simplifies the problem and improves the real time implement ability. In Trajectory Planning layer, to solve the time depended path planning problem of an unmanned combat aerial vehicles, we suggest a two step planner. In the first step, the planner explores the environment through a randomized reachability tree search using an approximate line segment model. The resulting connecting path is converted into flight way points through a line-of-sight segmentation. In the second step, every consecutive way points are connected with B-Spline curves and these curves are repaired probabilistically to obtain a geometrically and dynamically feasible path. This generated feasible path is turned in to time depended trajectory with using time scale factor considering the velocity and acceleration limits of the aircraft. Maneuver planning layer is constructed upon multi modal control framework, where the flight trajectories are decomposed to sequences of maneuver modes and associated parameters. Maneuver generation algorithm, makes use of mode transition rules and agility metric graphs to derive feasible maneuver parameters for each mode and overall sequence. Resulting integrated system; tested on simulations for 3D complex environments, gives satisfactory results and promises successful real time implementation. &copy; 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Different form the previous models, a descriptor time delay system model based on square root B-spline approximation is first established. To enhance the robust performance for the tracking problem, the mixed H2 and H-infinite performance is applied instead of the only H-infinite performance. The novel mixed H2 and H-infinite tracking problem is formulated as a optimization problem. Instead of the non-convex design algorithms, the improved linear-matrix-inequality (LMI) based convex algorithms are also proved for controller design.

  abstract  = {The main contribution of this paper is to provide a unified treatment to the problems of constrained minimum-time trajectory generation, fault detection and identification, and (after a fault has been detected and identified) trajectory reconfiguration, in an integrated scheme using a differential flatness and B-splines parameterisation. Using the flatness/B-splines parameterisation the problem of minimum-time constrained trajectory planning is cast into a feasibility-search problem in the splines control-points space, in which the constraint region is characterised by a polytope. A close approximation of the minimum-time trajectory is obtained by systematically searching the end-time that makes the constraint polytope to be minimally feasible. Fault detection is carried out by using B-splines in an FIR filter implementation. Thus, the threetraditionally dealt with separatelyproblems (namely, trajectory generation, fault detection, and trajectory reconfiguration) are solved in a unified manner, using the same mathematical/computational tools.

So parameter identification of impulse provides an effective approach for gearbox fault diagnosis. Biorthogonal B-spline wavelet has the properties of compact support, high vanishing moment and symmetry, which are suitable to signal de-noising, fast calculation, and reconstruction. Thus, a novel time frequency distribution method is present for gear fault diagnosis by biorthogonal B-spline wavelet. Simulation study concerning singularity signal shows that this wavelet is effective in identifying the fault feature with coefficients map and coefficients line. Furthermore, an integrated approach consisting of wavelet decomposition, Hilbert transform and power spectrum density is used in applications. The results indicate that this method can extract the gearbox fault characteristics and diagnose the fault patterns effectively. &copy; 2011 IFSA.},

  abstract  = {Pottmann et al. propose an iterative optimization scheme for approximating a target curve with a B-spline curve based on square distance minimization, or SDM. The main advantage of SDM is that it does not need a parameterization of data points on the target curve. Starting with an initial B-spline curve, this scheme makes an active B-spline curve converge faster towards the target curve and produces a better approximating B-spline curve than existing methods relying on data point parameterization. However, SDM is sensitive to the initial B-spline curve due to its local nature of optimization. To address this, we integrate SDM with procedures for automatically adjusting both the number and locations of the control points of the active spline curve. This leads to a method that is more robust and applicable than SDM used alone. Furthermore, it is observed that the most time consuming part of SDM is the repeated computation of the foot-point on the target curve of a sample point on the active B-spline curve. In our implementation, we speed up the foot-point computation by pre-computing the distance field of the target curve using the Fast Marching Method. Experimental examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Problems for further research are discussed. &copy; 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract  = {To achieve high-speed and high-accuracy machining, look-ahead scheme and parametric interpolator have shown significant effect on interpolating micro-line blocks. On the one hand, look-ahead schemes have been integrated in many computer numerical control (CNC) systems to alleviate the frequent start/stop motion and achieve a higher feedrate. However, the unsmooth speed at the segment junctions cannot be avoided entirely due to the discontinuous nature of the linearized-segmented contour. On the other hand, parametric interpolator has been proposed to overcome the shortcomings of the linear/circular interpolator. But, it is difficult to fit the blocks into parametric curves on-line. In this paper, a local cubic B-spline fitting algorithm with real-time look-ahead scheme is proposed for consecutive micro-line blocks interpolation. First, the consecutive micro-line blocks, which satisfy the bi-chord error constraint, are fitted into a continuous cubic B-spline curve. Second, machining dynamics and tool path contour constrains are taken into consideration. Third, an optimal look-ahead scheme is proposed to generate the optimal feedrate profile. Simulation and experiment are performed in real-time environment to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared with the conventional interpolation algorithm, the proposed algorithm reduces the machining time by 70%. &copy; 2010 IEEE.},

In this way, at first, by use of quartic B-splines, the authors have proceeded to solve the differential equation of motion governing SDOF systems and later the proposed method has been generalized for MDOF systems. In the proposed approach, a straightforward formulation was derived in a fluent manner from the approximation of response of the system with B-spline basis. Because of using a quartic function, the system acceleration is approximated with a parabolic function. For the aforesaid method, a simple step-by-step algorithm was implemented and presented to calculate dynamic response of MDOF systems. The proposed method has appropriate convergence, accuracy and low time consumption. Accuracy and stability analyses have been done perfectly in this paper. The proposed method benefits from an extraordinary accuracy compared to the existing methods such as central difference, Runge-Kutta and even Duhamel integration method. The validity and effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated with four examples and the results of this method are compared with those from some of the existent numerical methods. The high accuracy and less time consumption are only two advantages of this method. &copy; 2011.},

Firstly, the non-homogeneous term is fitted via a set of cubic B-spline functions. The graphs of B-spline functions are exactly the same in shape and only the starting point is different. A highly efficient numerical method for calculating the particular solution to the dynamic system is put forward. With this method, simply solve a dynamic equation of which the non-homogeneous term is a standard B-spline function, then by using the superpose principle, the particular solution is obtained. Together with the general solution which is calculated by the time-integration precise method, the solution satisfying the initial conditions is obtained. This new method avoids the inverse matrix calculations as the particular solution is calculated by numerical quadrature, therefore is valid in general cases.

It is obtained by a successive linearization of the Crank-Nicolson scheme, that is unconditionally stable, but requires solving non-linear equation at each time step. We applied our linearized scheme for the time integration of the challenging Cahn-Hilliard equation, modeling the phase separation in fluids. At each time step the resulting variational equation is solved using higher-order isogeometric finite element method, with B-spline basis functions. The method was implemented in the PETIGA framework interfaced via the PETSc toolkit. The GMRES iterative solver was utilized for the solution of a resulting linear system at every time step. We also apply a simple adaptivity rule, which increases the time step size when the number of GMRES iterations is lower than 30. We compared our method with a non-linear, two stage predictor-multicorrector scheme, utilizing a sophisticated step length adaptivity. We controlled the stability of our simulations by monitoring the Ginzburg-Landau free energy functional. The proposed integration scheme outperforms the two-stage competitor in terms of the execution time, at the same time having a similar evolution of the free energy functional. &copy; The Authors.

  abstract  = {This paper presents a new approach of meshless local B-spline based finite difference (FD) method for transient 2D heat conduction problems with nonhomogenous and time-dependent heat sources. In this method, any governing equations are discretized by B-spline approximation which is implemented as a generalized FD technique using local B-spline collocation scheme. The key aspect of the method is that any derivative is stated as neighboring nodal values based on B-spline interpolants. The set of neighboring nodes is allowed to be randomly distributed. This allows enhanced flexibility to be obtained in the simulation. The method is truly meshless as no mesh connectivity is required for field variable approximation or integration. Galerkin implicit scheme is employed for time integration. Several transient 2D heat conduction problems with nonuniform heat sources in arbitrary complex geometries are examined to show the efficacy of the method. Comparison of the simulation results with solutions from other numerical methods in the literature is given. Good agreement with reference numerical methods is obtained. The method is shown to be simple and accurate for the time-dependent problems. Copyright &copy; 2017 by ASME.},

  language  = {English},
  abstract  = {Ilk et al.&rsquo;s deconvolution algorithm using B-splines involves the Laplace transformation of the convolution equation with respect to production rate and wellbore pressure based on Duhamel principle. However, for common cases, the production rate function has &ldquo;discontinuity&rdquo; with respect to production time; it does not satisfy the precondition that the function to be transformed by Laplace transformation should be continuous. This inherent defect may directly cause enormous amount of computational time or even the failure of the numerical Laplace inversion in the deconvolution process. Based on these concerns, a fundamentally improved deconvolution algorithm using B-splines is presented here. In the convolution equation, the wellbore pressure derivative corresponding to constant unit production rate as the target of deconvolution is still represented by weighted summation of second-order B-splines; however, the computation process of the deconvolution is kept in the level of integral in the real time space instead of the Laplace space, for the reason that there will be no continuity requirement for the production rate function in the application of Duhamel principle for the deconvolution computation problem. According to the real production rate history, a technique of piecewise analytical integration is adopted for obtaining the elements of sensitivity matrix of a linear system with respect to weight coefficients; the linear system is generated by substituting the measured wellbore pressure data and corresponding variable production rate data into the convolution equation containing B-splines. The proposed direct analytical solution method of the integration for calculating the elements of the sensitivity matrix can not only guarantee the success of the deconvolution computation, but also can largely enhance the deconvolution computation speed. Moreover, in order to further improve the computation speed, a binary search method is also applied to find which production segments (with constant production rate) the measured wellbore pressure data points locate at in the deconvolution computation process. Another linear system with respect to weight coefficients for the regularization from Ilk et al.&rsquo;s deconvolution algorithm is appended in order to overcome the effect of data errors. The two linear systems are combined together as an over-determined linear system, which can be solved by the least square method. Eventually, the reconstructed wellbore pressure and its derivative by B-splines corresponding to the constant unit production rate can be obtained. Numerical experimental tests demonstrate that the improved deconvolution algorithm exhibits good accuracy, computation speed and stability of data error tolerance. And the statement on how to perform the regularization when data error exists is also made in order to deconvolve the correct wellbore pressure derivative. The improved deconvolution algorithm is also applied into an actual field example. It is found that the deconvolution results by the improved deconvolution algorithm have good agreement with the ones by Von Schroeter et al.&rsquo;s deconvolution algorithm and by Levitan et al.&rsquo;s deconvolution algorithm as a whole; and the feature of typical log-log curves of the wellbore pressure drop and the wellbore pressure derivative corresponding to the improved algorithm is very close to the one of typical log-log curves calculated directly from the wellbore pressure data in the well shut-in period. In addition, through many numerical experimental tests, it is also concluded that as the quantity of data largely increases, the improved Ilk et al.'s deconvolution algorithm exhibits the big advantage in fast computational speed over von Schroeter et al.&rsquo;s algorithm and Levitan et al.&rsquo;s algorithm. &copy; 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

However, each surface is distinct and requires a specific equation describing the shape of the surface to be formulated in each case. These equations impact on the numerical implementation, specifically relating to stress integration, of the models and therefore a separate algorithm must be constructed for each model. This paper presents, for the first time, a way to construct yield surfaces using techniques from non-uniform rational basis spline (NURBS) surfaces, such that any isotropic convex yield envelope can be represented within the same framework. These surfaces are combined with an implicit backward-Euler-type stress integration algorithm to provide a flexible numerical framework for computational plasticity. The algorithm is inherently stable as the iterative process starts and remains on the yield surface throughout the stress integration. The performance of the algorithm is explored using both material point investigations and boundary value analyses demonstrating that the framework can be applied to a variety of plasticity models. &copy; 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract  = {The detection of lane boundaries on suburban streets using images obtained from video constitutes a challenging task. This is mainly due to the difficulties associated with estimating the complex geometric structure of lane boundaries, the quality of lane markings as a result of wear, occlusions by traffic, and shadows caused by road-side trees and structures. Most of the existing techniques for lane boundary detection employ a single visual cue and will only work under certain conditions and where there are clear lane markings. Also, better results are achieved when there are no other onroad objects present. This paper extends our previous work and discusses a novel lane boundary detection algorithm specifically addressing the abovementioned issues through the integration of two visual cues. The first visual cue is based on stripe-like features found on lane lines extracted using a two-dimensional symmetric Gabor filter. The second visual cue is based on a texture characteristic determined using the entropy measure of the predefined neighbourhood around a lane boundary line. The visual cues are then integrated using a rulebased classifier which incorporates a modified sequential covering algorithm to improve robustness. To separate lane boundary lines from other similar features, a road mask is generated using road chromaticity values estimated from CIE L*a*b* colour transformation. Extraneous points around lane boundary lines are then removed by an outlier removal procedure based on studentized residuals. The lane boundary lines are then modelled with Bezier spline curves. To validate the algorithm, extensive experimental evaluation was carried out on suburban streets and the results are presented. &copy; 2014 The Author(s). Licensee InTech.},

  abstract  = {A general mathematical framework is proposed, in this paper, to define new quadrature rules in the context of B-spline/NURBS-based isogeometric analysis. High order continuity across the elements within a patch turned out to have higher accuracy than C<sup>0</sup> finite elements, as well as a better time efficiency. Unfortunately, a maximum regularity accentuates the shear and membrane locking in thick structural elements. The improved selective reduced integration schemes are given for uni-dimensional beam problems, with basis functions of order two and three, and can be easily extended to higher orders. The resulting B-spline/NURBS finite elements are free from membrane and transverse shear locking. Moreover, no zero energy modes are generated. The performance of the approach is evaluated on the classical test of a cantilever beam subjected to a distributed moment, and compared to Lagrange under-integrated finite elements. &copy; 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract  = {This paper discusses fundamental issues related to the integration of computer aided design and analysis (I-CAD-A) by introducing a new class of ideal compliant joints that account for the distributed inertia and elasticity. The absolute nodal coordinate formulation (ANCF) degrees of freedom are used in order to capture modes of deformation that cannot be captured using existing formulations. The ideal compliant joints developed can be formulated, for the most part, using linear algebraic equations, allowing for the elimination of the dependent variables at a preprocessing stage, thereby significantly reducing the problem dimension and array storage needed. Furthermore, the constraint equations are automatically satisfied at the position, velocity, and acceleration levels. When using the proposed approach to model large scale chain systems, differences in computational efficiency between the augmented formulation and the recursive methods are eliminated, and the CPU times resulting from the use of the two formulations become similar regardless of the complexity of the system. The elimination of the joint constraint equations and the associated dependent variables also contribute to the solution of a fundamental singularity problem encountered in the analysis of closed loop chains and mechanisms by eliminating the need to repeatedly change the chain or mechanism independent coordinates. It is shown that the concept of the knot multiplicity used in computational geometry methods, such as B-spline and NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline), to control the degree of continuity at the breakpoints is not suited for the formulation of many ideal compliant joints. As explained in this paper, this issue is closely related to the inability of Bspline and NURBS to model structural discontinuities. Another contribution of this paper is demonstrating that large deformation ANCF finite elements can be effective, in some MBS application, in solving small deformation problems. This is demonstrated using a heavily constrained tracked vehicle with flexible link chains. Without using the proposed approach, modeling such a complex system with flexible links can be very challenging. The analysis presented in this paper also demonstrates that adding significant model details does not necessarily imply increasing the complexity of the MBS algorithm.

An isogeometric spline forest is a hierarchical spline representation capable of representing surfaces or volumes of arbitrarily complex geometry and topological genus. Spline forests can accomodate arbitrary degree and smoothness in the underlying hierarchical basis as well as non-uniform knot interval configurations. We describe adaptive h-refinement and coarsening algorithms for isogeometric spline forests and develop a Be&acute;zier extraction framework which provides a simple and efficient single level finite element description of the complex multi-level, unstructured hierarchical spline basis. We then demonstrate the potential of spline forests as a basis for analysis in the context of transient advection-diffusion problems where fully integrated adaptivity is demonstrated for the first time in an isogeometric simulation. In all cases, the adaptive process remains local (even in the case of moving fronts) and preserves exact geometry at the coarsest level of the discretization. The accuracy and robustness of the approach is demonstrated in all cases. &copy; 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract  = {Over recent years there has been a growing demand for materials that possess a wide variation of constitutive properties, which may not naturally occur within homogeneous materials. The evolution of composite materials has led to the development of a relatively new class, commonly referred to as functionally graded materials, which consist of two or more materials (often metals and ceramics) with properties varying continuously with respect to spatial coordinates. In this paper, the dynamic response of a functionally graded (FG) beam is analysed using the wavelet finite element method (WFEM). The scaling functions of the Daubechies wavelet and B-spline wavelet on the interval (BSWI) families are employed as interpolating functions for the construction of the wavelet-based FG beam elements; based on Euler Bernoulli beam theory. The FG beam, comprising of steel and alumina, is assumed to vary continuously in the transverse and axial directions according to the power law. The free vibrations behaviour of a FG beam with different material distributions is compared with other approaches from published data to validate and assess the performance of this formulation. A FG beam resting on a viscoelastic foundation is analysed when subjected to a moving point load. The dynamic responses are evaluated using the Newmark time integration method. The effects of the material distribution, velocity of the moving load and damping of the system are discussed based on the numerical examples presented. The results indicate that WFEMs achieve higher levels of accuracy with fewer elements implemented, in comparison to the classical finite element method, in the analysis of the FG beam. Furthermore, the BSWI wavelet-based approach performs better than the Daubechies-based WFEM. &copy; 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

  abstract  = {Even though isogeometric analysis has a clear advantage regarding the number of degrees of freedom needed to achieve a certain level of accuracy, the time needed for matrix assembly (by means of numerical integration of stiffness or mass matrix entries) constitutes a severe bottleneck in the process. In order to overcome this difficulty, we propose the new approach of Integration by Interpolation and Lookup (IIL). Firstly, applying spline interpolation to the common factors in the occurring integrals approximately transforms them into integrals of piecewise polynomial functions, whose integrands are expressed in tensor-product B-spline form. The common factors represent the influence of the geometry mapping (i.e.,the NURBS domain parameterization) and the contributions of possibly non-constant material coefficients. Secondly, these integrals are evaluated exactly using pre-computed look-up tables for integrals of tri-products of univariate B-splines and their derivatives. For the model case of elliptic problems, we perform a theoretical analysis to demonstrate that the IIL method maintains the overall approximation order of the Galerkin discretization, provided that the spline interpolation is sufficiently accurate. Moreover, we provide a comparison of the computational complexity of our method with that of a standard Gauss quadrature method. Finally, we present experimental results to illustrate the performance of the IIL method and to support our theoretical results. &copy; 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

This system is composed of a rectangular cavity containing an interior scatterer coupled to an external scatterer through a slot mounted on a cavity wall. In order to make the problem mathematically tractable, Time-Domain Electric Field Integral Equations based on the equivalence principle and the boundary conditions are developed. Thus, the Method of Moments is applied in space and time-domains to solve the equation system. In time-domain, the temporal part of the unknown coefficients is expressed as linear combination of: the Laguerre functions in the first solution and the B-Spline functions in the second one. The transient responses of the system are obtained by the two proposed techniques. In the light of the comparison results, the Laguerre functions are shown to be the more accurate. Based on these functions, a coupling study between the components of the proposed system is conducted. &copy; 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

For this reason, it is often preferable to use suboptimal weight functions that simplify the implementation of the SCs. One promising class of suboptimal weight functions is based on B-splines.

These applications demand the use of high performance controllers. Some desirable characteristics in motion controllers are coordinated multi-axis control, smooth movements, and advanced interpolation methods. An important manufacturing aspect involves the production of a workpiece in a free form or using the parametric surfaces in modern computer aided design/computer aided manufacturing systems. The use of parametric curves and surfaces has become standard due to their ability to represent objects having complex surfaces with less data. Another mandatory characteristic of motion controllers is the real-time operation. The contribution of the present work is the design and implementation of a hardware-software system for multi-axis motion control featuring non uniform rational B-splines interpolation. Advantages over other reported works are the hardware implementation which allows the application to real computer numerically controlled machines; also the parallel processing permits the incorporation of additional modules to form an integral system without dependence on external devices.

  abstract  = {Minimizing the operating clearance between rotating bladed-disks and stationary surrounding casings is a primary concern in the design of modern turbomachines since it may advantageously affect their energy efficiency. This technical choice possibly leads to interactions between elastic structural components through direct unilateral contact and dry friction, events which are now accepted as normal operating conditions. Subsequent nonlinear dynamical behaviors of such systems are commonly investigated with simplified academic models mainly due to theoretical difficulties and numerical challenges involved in non-smooth large-scale realistic models. In this context, the present paper introduces an adaptation of a full three-dimensional contact strategy for the prediction of potentially damaging motions that would imply highly demanding computational efforts for the targeted aerospace application in an industrial context. It combines a smoothing procedure including bicubic B-spline patches together with a Lagrange multiplier based contact strategy within an explicit time-marching integration procedure preferred for its versatility. The proposed algorithm is first compared on a benchmark configuration against the more elaborated bi-potential formulation and the commercial software Ansys. The consistency of the provided results and the low energy fluctuations of the introduced approach underlines its reliable numerical properties. A case study featuring blade-tip/casing contact on industrial finite element models is then proposed: it incorporates component mode synthesis and the developed three-dimensional contact algorithm for investigating structural interactions occurring within a turbomachine compressor stage. Both time results and frequency-domain analysis emphasize the practical use of such a numerical tool: detection of severe operating conditions and critical rotational velocities, time-dependent maps of stresses acting within the structures, parameter studies and blade design tests. &copy; 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract  = {This paper addresses the problem of above-threshold ionization (ATI) of hydrogen interacting with a short and intense x-ray electromagnetic field. We consider the weakly relativistic regime where the speed of the photoelectron stays well below the velocity of the light c. We solve the time-dependent Schro&die;dinger equation (TDSE) using a spectral approach with a basis of one-electron orbitals, calculated with L2-integrable B-spline functions for the radial coordinate and bipolar spherical harmonics Y<inf>lm</inf> for the angular part. Retardation effects are included up to O(1/c); they induce two extra terms leading to electric quadrupole and magnetic dipole transitions. These latter terms depend on the polarization and photon momentum directions, forcing the resolution of the TDSE in a three-dimensional space. Relativistic effects [of O(1/c2)] are fully neglected. Photoelectron energy and angular distributions are obtained for photon energies ranging from 200 eV to 3 keV. We study the lower energy region of the ATI spectrum and we analyze nondipole effects, through their (l,m) components, in particular, for the lower two peaks. Although these effects are small, we show that, increasing the photon energy, the photoelectron angular distributions begin to differ significantly from the ones obtained in dipole approximation. &copy; 2012 American Physical Society.},

  abstract  = {This article considers the following manufacturing/logistics problem: an autonomous vehicle (AV) is requested to serve a set of pickup and delivery (P/D) stations in the shop floor of a modern factory providing P/D tasks while moving safely (i.e., avoiding any collision with obstacles) in its environment. A two-sided time window associated with each P/D station brackets the service time to within a specified interval. A tour for AV is considered legal if it (a) is collision free, (b) passes through each P/D station exactly once, and (c) satisfies the service time restrictions imposed by the P/D stations. A legal tour always starts and ends at a depot. The problem is thereby dual NP-hard because it combines the characteristics of path planning and those of vehicle routing and scheduling problems. The objective is to determine the shortest possible legal tour for AV. A new method is introduced to solve the problem accomplished in two successive phases: first, AV's environment is mapped into a 2D B-spline surface embedded in 3D Euclidean space using a robust geometric model. Then, the generated surface is searched using a genetic algorithm for an optimum legal tour that satisfies the requirements of the vehicle's mission. The performance of the proposed method is investigated and discussed through characteristic simulated experiments. Copyright &copy; 2012 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, we present a method for coronary artery motion tracking in 4D cardiac CT angiogram data sets. The proposed method allows the construction of patient-specific 4D coronary motion model from pre-operative CTA which can be used for guiding totally endoscopic coronary artery bypass surgery (TECAB). The proposed approach consists of three steps: Firstly, the coronary arteries are extracted in the end-diastolic time frame using a minimal cost path approach. To achieve this, the start and end points of the coronaries are identified interactively and the minimal cost path between the start and end points is computed using A*graph search algorithm. Secondly, the cardiac motion is estimated throughout the cardiac cycle by using a non-rigid image registration technique based on a free-form B-spline transformation model and maximization of normalized mutual information. Finally, coronary arteries are tracked automatically through all other phases of the cardiac cycle. This is estimated by deforming the extracted coronaries at end-diastole to all other time frames according the motion field acquired in second step. The estimated coronary centerlines are then refined by template matching algorithm to improve the accuracy. We compare the proposed approach with two alternative approaches: The first approach is based on the minimal cost path extraction of the coronaries with start and end points manually identified in each time frame while the second approach is based on propagating the extracted coronaries from the end-diastolic time frame to other time frames using image-based non-rigid registration only. Our results show that the proposed approach performs more robustly than the non-rigid registration based method and that the resulting motion model is comparable to the motion model constructed from semi-automatic extractions of the coronaries in all time frames. &copy; 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

To overcome the shortcoming of modeling using the static B-spline basis function, dynamic basis functions are used to carry out the iterative modeling and fault tolerant control. By separating the whole control horizon into certain number of the time domain sub-intervals called batches, in each batch, the radial basis function (RBF) is fixed and the adaptive observer based fault diagnosis algorithm is used to estimate the size of the fault. Between two batches, the centers and widths of the RBF, the gain of the fault diagnosis observer and the parameters of the controller should all be tuned. In the next batch, the post-tuning RBF are used to approximate the output PDF and the post-tuning fault tolerant controller is used to act on the system, leading to integrated fault diagnosis and fault tolerant control. &copy; 2013 TCCT, CAA.},

  abstract  = {Context. The Gaia mission will produce a stereoscopic map of the Milky Way by collecting highly accurate positions, parallaxes and proper motions for about 1 billion stars. These astrometric parameters will be determined through the astrometric core solution of the Gaia mission which will employ about 10 <sup>8</sup> primary sources (a subset of the observed sources with the best astrometric properties). The attitude of the spacecraft is reconstructed as part of the astrometric solution and provides the reference frame relative to which the astrometric measurements are obtained. This implies extreme demands on the accuracy of the attitude reconstruction. Aims. This paper presents an analysis of the capabilities and limitations of the Gaia attitude reconstruction, focusing on the effects on the astrometry of bright (V a&circ;&permil; 11) stars and the implications of employing cubic B-splines in the modelling of the attitude measurements. Methods. We simulate the attitude of the spacecraft using a realistic and very detailed model that considers not only physical effects but also technical aspects like the control system and thruster noise. We include the effect of shorter integration times for the bright stars on the effective attitude and we estimate the residual modelling noise in the reconstruction of the attitude. Results. We provide an analysis of the dependency of the residual modelling noise in the reconstructed attitude with respect to the following parameters: integration time, B-spline knot interval, micro-propulsion system noise, and number of observations per second. Conclusions. The final noise in the attitude reconstruction for Gaia is estimated to be &asyum;20 &mu;as, and the main source will be the micro-propulsion system. However its effect on the astrometric performance will be limited, adding up to 7 &mu;as rms to the parallax uncertainties. This is larger than the 4 &mu;as from previous estimations and would affect the performance for the brightest (V &permil; 11) stars. &copy; 2013 ESO.},

  abstract  = {A set of techniques was developed for automatically detecting tectonic lineaments from multi-source remotely-sensed data at various scales. The techniques include adaptive shading of grid data to enhance linear features, a segment-tracing algorithm to extract line segments from the shaded grid data, grouping of the segments by concatenating short segments, and connecting them by proximity and co-linearity criteria to form a lineament that represents significant tectonic structure. B-spline smoothing was adopted for lineament representation. Finally, a technique for assessing the orientations and styles of faulting (normal, reverse, and strike-slip types) was developed for use in characterizing the extrapolated fracture planes. The applicability of the developed techniques was examined using 30. arc-second topography/bathymetry grids, 1-min gravity anomaly grids, and 2-min total field magnetic intensity grids covering Egypt and its surroundings. Lineaments derived from data types so diverse in composition and from various depths corresponded well with the referenced tectonic features over much of the region. Prominent trends and faulting styles of lineaments provided important clues as to the timing of their development as well as strong support for a structural inheritance model. Results demonstrated the effectiveness of the developed techniques combined with integration of remotely-sensed data in detecting regional fracture systems accurately and in characterizing geodynamics over a long timeframe. &copy; 2011 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

  abstract  = {An efficient gradient-based algorithm for aerodynamic shape optimization is presented. The algorithm consists of several components, including a novel integrated geometry parameterization and mesh movement, a parallel Newton-Krylov flow solver, and an adjoint-based gradient evaluation. To integrate geometry parameterization and mesh movement, generalized B-spline volumes are used to parameterize both the surface and volume mesh. The volume mesh of B-spline control points mimics a coarse mesh; a linear elasticity mesh-movement algorithm is applied directly to this coarse mesh and the fine mesh is regenerated algebraically. Using this approach, mesh-movement time is reduced by two to three orders of magnitude relative to a node-based movement. The mesh-adjoint system also becomes smaller and is thus amenable to complex-step derivative approximations. When solving the flow-adjoint equations using restarted Krylov-subspace methods, a nested-subspace strategy is shown to be more robust than truncating the entire subspace. Optimization is accomplished using a sequential-quadratic-programming algorithm. The effectiveness of the complete algorithm is demonstrated using a lift-constrained induced-drag minimization that involves large changes in geometry. Copyright &copy; 2009 by J. E. Hicken and D.W.

  abstract  = {In this paper, we present a minimum-time/jerk algorithm for trajectory planning and its experimental validation. The algorithm search for a trade-off between the need for a short execution time and the requirement of a sufficiently smooth trajectory, which is the well known necessary condition to limit the vibration during fast movements. The trade-off is achieved by adjusting the weight of two suitable functions, able to consider both the execution time and the squared-jerk integral along the whole trajectory. The main feature of this algorithm is its ability to smooth the trajectory's profile by adjusting the intervals between two consecutive via-points so that the overall time is minimally delayed. The practical importance of this technique lies in the fact that it can be implemented in any industrialmanipulator without a hardware upgrade. The algorithm does not need for a dynamic model of the robot: only the mechanical constraints on the position, velocity and acceleration ranges have to be set a priori. The experimental proof is provided in this paper by comparing the results of the proposed algorithm with those obtained by adopting some classical algorithms. &copy; Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.},

  abstract  = {Path generations are a necessary integral part of any automated machining approach using 3-axis robots. Given an input path in form of a piecewise linear curve, we automatically generate an optimized path that lies within a given error bound or tolerance band of the input path. The optimization is targeted at minimizing the processing time of the machining process. As sharp turns require the robot to slow down, we want to minimize the local curvature at each point of the curve. Our approach is an efficient offline algorithm that consists of several processing steps. Ina preprocessing step, we analyze the input path and split it into small groups. The groups are categorized and can be handled independently and locally. We apply a local sleeve concept for complicated groups and a local Bezierapproximation for simple groups. In a post processing step the groups are combined to form a G<sup>2</sup>-continuous path. Our approach achieves high-quality results that are comparable to the sleeves approach while being significantly more efficient (speed-up of one order of magnitude) when applied to real-world problems. &copy; 2011 IEEE.},

The exactness of interface is kept by updating the control points according to the kinematics obtained from response analysis.

Here, a numerical study is presented that describes the photomechanical structural dynamic behavior of an LCN in a fluid medium; however, the methodology is also applicable to fluid-structure interactions of a broader range of adaptive structures. Here, we simulate the oscillation of photomechanical cantilevers excited by light while simultaneously modeling the effect of the surrounding fluid at different ambient pressures. The photoactuated LCN is modeled as an elastic thin cantilever plate, and gradients in photostrain from the external light are computed from the assumptions of light absorption and photoisomerization through the film thickness. Numerical approximations of the equations governing the plate are based on cubic B-spline shape functions and a second order implicit Newmark central scheme for time integration. For the fluid, three dimensional unsteady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved using the arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) method, which employs a structured body-fitted curvilinear coordinate system where the solid-fluid interface is a mesh line of the system, and the complicated interface boundary conditions are accommodated in a conventional finite-volume formulation. Numerical examples are given which provide new insight into material behavior in a fluid medium as a function of ambient pressure. &copy; 2012.},

  abstract  = {Direct-drive linear reciprocating compressors offer numerous advantages over conventional counterparts which are usually driven by a rotary induction motor via a crank shaft. However, to ensure efficient and reliable operation under all conditions, it is essential that motor current of a linear compressor follows a sinusoidal current command with a frequency which matches the system resonant frequency. The design of a high-performance current controller for linear compressor drive presents a challenge since the system is highly nonlinear, and an effective solution must be low cost. In this paper, a learning feed-forward current controller for the linear compressors is proposed. It comprises a conventional feedback proportional-integral controller and a feed-forward B-spline neural network (BSNN). The feed-forward BSNN is trained online and in real time in order to minimize the current tracking error. Extensive simulation and experiment results with a prototype linear compressor show that the proposed current controller exhibits high steady state and transient performance. &copy; 2009 IEEE.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents a new registration algorithm, called Temporal Diffeomorphic Free Form Deformation (TDFFD), and its application to motion and strain quantification from a sequence of 3D ultrasound (US) images. The originality of our approach resides in enforcing time consistency by representing the 4D velocity field as the sum of continuous spatiotemporal B-Spline kernels. The spatiotemporal displacement field is then recovered through forward Eulerian integration of the non-stationary velocity field. The strain tensor is computed locally using the spatial derivatives of the reconstructed displacement field. The energy functional considered in this paper weighs two terms: the image similarity and a regularization term. The image similarity metric is the sum of squared differences between the intensities of each frame and a reference one. Any frame in the sequence can be chosen as reference. The regularization term is based on the incompressibility of myocardial tissue. TDFFD was compared to pairwise 3D FFD and 3D+t FFD, both on displacement and velocity fields, on a set of synthetic 3D US images with different noise levels. TDFFD showed increased robustness to noise compared to these two state-of-the-art algorithms. TDFFD also proved to be more resistant to a reduced temporal resolution when decimating this synthetic sequence. Finally, this synthetic dataset was used to determine optimal settings of the TDFFD algorithm. Subsequently, TDFFD was applied to a database of cardiac 3D US images of the left ventricle acquired from 9 healthy volunteers and 13 patients treated by Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT). On healthy cases, uniform strain patterns were observed over all myocardial segments, as physiologically expected. On all CRT patients, the improvement in synchrony of regional longitudinal strain correlated with CRT clinical outcome as quantified by the reduction of end-systolic left ventricular volume at follow-up (6 and 12. months), showing the potential of the proposed algorithm for the assessment of CRT. &copy; 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

In the article, first, we analyzed the actual requirements of the textile factory, researched the weaknesses in the used monitoring systems, and proposed a production monitoring and management system model based on multi-agent. Then, we made the system collect the data in a central point, divided data into two parts (noise and use-full information), and analyzed the correlation of material data. Third, we compared the results of several data fitting, and finally decided to use B-spline function to optimize the material data. Finally, using agent technique, expert system and fuzzy control theory, we evaluated data results of the textile material. As verified by application, on being compared with the used monitoring systems, multi-agent monitoring and management system can objectively reflect production process of textile materials, achieve comprehensive management and information integration, and realize data sharing and scientific management for all of the workshops. &copy; The Author(s), 2010.},

Meanwhile, the generalized PID controller structure and the improved convex linear matrix inequalities (LMI) algorithms are proposed to fulfil the tracking problem.

  abstract  = {This paper presents a new Boundary Element Method (BEM) in the direct time domain for the solution of the wave propagation problem in 3D homogenous inviscid acoustic media. The methodology is based on impulse response techniques. To this end, the fundamental solutions associated with the Boundary Integral Equation are derived for concentrated sources of higher order B-spline time modulation. High order spatial discretization is adopted. The solution is obtained in two major steps. First the B-spline Impulse Response Functions (BIRF) for a system of a specific geometry are calculated. BIRF functions are independent of the actual external excitation and need to be calculated only once for a given geometry. The second step calculates the response of the system to arbitrary excitations through a mere superposition of the BIRF functions. This paper discusses the development of the proposed BEM methodology and its validation. The method is shown to be stable regardless of the selection of the analysis time step, as opposed to the retarded potential techniques reported in the literature. The high level of accuracy and the efficiency of the method are demonstrated. &copy; 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

An integral sliding mode controller is used for trajectory tracking. The closed-loop stability of the tracking errors is guaranteed in spite of unknown disturbances. It is also shown that this strategy is particularly useful if integral sliding mode control is combined with other methods to further robustify against perturbations.

Results for the three algorithms are compared by studying the propagation of the solitary wave, interaction of the solitary waves, wave generation and birth of solitons. &copy; 2007.},

  abstract  = {Cells use a variety of methods to migrate. One of these, referred to as amoeboid motion, involves alternating cycles of morphological expansion and retraction [1]. Employed by numerous mammalian cell lines including neutrophils and lymphocytes [2], [3], it is also seen in the metastatic migration of some tumor cells [4]. Amoeboid motility is best understood in the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum. It is a complex cellular process driven by highly-organized cytoskeletal dynamics containing numerous molecular species and regulated by an intricate signaling network. An important aspect of studying is to understand how the roles played by these molecules and signaling pathways are integrated. And a widely used approach is to characterize phenotype-specific morphological dynamics among various types of cells. Traditionally, amoeboid motility has been characterized by a number of different parameters [5]. Some, such as velocity, directional persistence, and chemotactic index, are determined by the position of the cell's centroid as it migrates in response to external chemical cues, a process known as chemotaxis. Characterizations which address cellular morphology are based on cell shape parameters such as perimeter, area, roundness, and body orientation. Though these parameters can be used to identify some differences between strains of chemotactic cells, they primarily provide global information about chemotaxis and chemoattractant-induced cell shape changes, hence are insufficient to distinguish cell strains based on local morphological information, such as pseudopodial protrusions, that typify amoeboid motility. When the activities of pseudopodia are described in some studies, the protrusions have been identified and outlined manually [6], [7]. In addition to being highly time consuming, these manual methods have the drawback that they are based on subjective judgements. Thus, an efficient and systematic approach is necessary for cell shape characterization. Here, we develop a series of automated methods to characterize amoeboid locomotion based on the skeleton of a planar shape [8]. Skeletonization, also known as the medial axis transform, is a technique in morphological image processing used to reduce a binary shape into a series of connected lines - the skeleton - which roughly maintain the form of the shape. Though it has long been used to analyze static shapes in cell biology [9]-[12], skeletonization has not been used to track dynamic shape information during amoeboid motility. To achieve this, three imaging techniques were used to acquire movies of motile Dictyostelium cells during chemotaxis: fluorescent, phase-contrast, and differential interference contrast (DIC). Accordingly, three different image segmentation approaches were designed to generate binary images from these movies, where the white regions represented cell area and the black ones were background. Next, to remove high-frequency spatial fluctuations resulted from image noise, quadratic B-spline curves were fitted to cell boundaries based on the shape-space model and recursive least-square estimation [13]. Skeletonization was then used to extract the skeleton of each cell shape in the movies. Because the original skeletons were sensitive to small boundary variations, branch pruning was used following to eliminate the spurious ones based on the length of a branch and the local curvature of the corresponding boundary curve. Finally, these pruned skeletons were combined with the shape difference, which was defined as either "positive flow" or "negative flow" of a cell during motility, to locate pseudopodia protrusions and retractions (Fig. 1) and compute their angles and lengths. Our methods are capable of capturing the stochastic features of pseudopodial protrusions and retractions for various phenotypes. For example, we can quantify a cell's protrusion efficiency when moving toward the chemoattractant by looking at the angle distribution of protrusions along the membrane [14], [15]. This has been shown to provide more information compared to chemotactic index, a widely used quantity to characterize chemotaxis efficiency. Moreover, our methods are able to describe the temporal dynamics of individual pseudopodia by obtaining the time series of protrusion and retraction angles, and modeling it using a second-order autoregressive process [16]. Analysis based on these dynamics can provide various quantities to characterize pseudopodial activities among different phenotypes, such as lifetimes, splitting rates, and state persistences. Furthermore, our results can be coupled with the measurements of different cellular component distributions along the cell body, thus facilitate the understanding of the relation between cellular polarization and motility. &copy; 2009 IEEE.},

  abstract  = {A digital/analog hybrid system is presented which implements the cardinal polynomial spline interpolation of arbitrary degree. Based on the fact that the (m - 1)st derivative of a spline of degree m - 1 is a staircase function, this system generates a cardinal spline of degree m - 1 by m - 1 cascaded integrators with a staircase function input. A given sequence of sampled values are transformed by a digital filter into coefficients for the B-spline representation of the spline interpolating the sampled values. The values of its (m - 1)st derivative with respect to time are computed by the recurrence formula interpreting differentiation of the spline as difference of the coefficients. Then a digital-to-analog converter generates a staircase function representing the (m - 1)st derivative, which is integrated by a cascade of m - 1 analog integrators to make the expected spline. In order to cope with the offset errors involved in the integrators, a dynamical sampled-data control is attached. An analog-to-digital converter is employed to sample the output of the cascaded integrators. Target state of the cascaded integrators at each sampling instance is computed from the coefficients for the B-spline representation. The state error between the target and the estimated is compensated by feeding back a weighted sum of the state error to the staircase input.},

  abstract  = {In recent years, volumetric (3D) cardiac ultrasound imaging has become more readily available in daily clinical practice due to the introduction of matrix array transducer technology. To date, quantitative analysis of these data sets typically requires a significant amount of user interaction. Recently, our teams introduced methods that could help in automating this process. On the one hand, an edge detection algorithm in combination with a deformable subdivision surface was presented for automatic segmentation of the LV cavity. A real-time, dynamic implementation of this segmentation approach in combination with a Kalman filter allows tracking the subendocardial boundary throughout the cardiac cycle. This method is referred to as RCTL. On the other hand, an automatic 3D motion estimation algorithm was presented in which subsequent image volumes are elastically registered using a B-spline transformation field. This method is called splineMIRIT. Both methods were applied to clinical data to extract relevant functional parameters on global left ventricular (LV) function (i.e. stroke volume (SV) and ejection fraction (EF)). Both methods show a good correlation with the reference method and might thus be used for fully automated estimation of global LV function. Given that RCTL is a fully integrated method (accounting for both segmentation and tracking) it seems to be the better approach towards extracting these parameters. However, whether this remains true when assessing parameters for regional LV function remains to be investigated. &copy;2009 IEEE.},

  abstract  = {The knowledge of the electron density is the key point in correcting ionospheric delays of electromagnetic measurements and in studying the ionosphere. During the last decade GNSS, in particular GPS, has become a promising tool for monitoring the total electron content (TEC), i.e., the integral of the electron density along the ray-path between the transmitting satellite and the receiver. Hence, geometry-free GNSS measurements provide informations on the electron density, which is basically a four-dimensional function depending on spatial position and time. In addition, these GNSS measurements can be combined with other available data including nadir, over-ocean TEC observations from dual-frequency radar altimetry (T/P, JASON, ENVISAT), and TECs from GPS-LEO occultation systems (e.g., FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC, CHAMP) with heterogeneous sampling and accuracy. In this paper, we present different multi-dimensional approaches for modeling spatio-temporal variations of the ionospheric electron density. To be more specific, we split the target function into a reference part, computed from the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI), and an unknown correction term. Due to the localizing feature of B-spline functions we apply tensor-product spline expansions to model the correction term in a certain multi-dimensional region either completely or partly. Furthermore, the multi-resolution representation derived from wavelet analysis allows monitoring the ionosphere at different resolutions levels. For demonstration we apply three approaches to electron density data over South America. &copy; 2007 COSPAR.},

Major challenges in these missions are posed by uncertainties in atmospheric properties like density and winds. A guidance algorithm based on optimal control theory and integrated with a nonlinear Structured Adaptive Model Inversion controller is developed, implemented and evaluated in this paper. The guidance algorithm uses B-spline parametrization of states to generate dynamically feasible optimal trajectories which steer the vehicle from entry interface conditions to a Final Approach Corridor, while simultaneously satisfying terminal conditions. Guidance trajectory acts as a reference trajectory for nonlinear adaptive controller which further generates the commanded moments based on reference input. Reaction control jet selection is accomplished using discrete control allocation. Discrete control allocation method can also handle various types of control failures. Performance is evaluated with a Mars Ellipsled vehicle non real-time simulation for a complete Mars entry trajectory tracking scenario. Simulation results presented in the paper demonstrate that the guidance algorithm generates the optimal trajectory under various terminal constraints while the fault tolerant control algorithm satisfactorily track this optimal trajectory in the presence of plant and environment uncertainties, in addition to control failures.

  abstract  = {The dynamic motion of a solder droplet during assembly is a complex, unsteady, free surface problem involving surface tension and viscous effects. The motion of the droplet is coupled with the motion of the component or chip to be assembled and involves dynamic contact lines. A methodology based on a non-uniform rational b-spline (NURBS) discretization has been developed for the dynamic analysis of the droplet motion. A surface energy based formulation has been developed to incorporate the surface tension effects. The developed methodology leads to an updated Lagrangian scheme with a Galerkin in space and Least square in time formulation. The NURBS representation used for the spatial discretization enables the method to handle problems involving complex droplet geometries. The ability of the NURBS representation to provide both global and local control, along with the least square method used in this methodology, enables us to develop an unconditionally stable time integration scheme which can be optimized to achieve desired accuracy and numerical dissipation efficiently. A sample problem of droplet shape evolution has been solved to demonstrate the path prediction capability of the proposed methodology. In future, the method can be applied to solve various real world dynamic motion problems associated with droplets.},

  abstract  = {In fluid power system simulation, orifice flow is, in the main, clearly in the turbulent area. Only when a valve is closed or an actuator driven against an end stopper does the flow become laminar as pressure drop over the orifice approaches zero. So, in terms of accuracy, the description of laminar flow is hardly necessary. Unfortunately, when a purely turbulent description of the orifice is used, numerical problems occur when pressure drop becomes close to zero since the first derivative of flow with respect of pressure drop approaches infinity when pressure drop approaches zero. Furthermore, the second derivative becomes discontinuous, which causes numerical noise and an infinitely small integration step when a variable step integrator is used. In this paper, a numerically efficient model for the orifice flow is proposed using a cubic spline function to describe the flow in the laminar and transition areas. Parameters for the cubic spline are selected such that its first derivative is equal to the first derivative of the pure turbulent orifice flow model in the boundary condition. The key advantage of this model comes from the fact that no geometrical data is needed in calculation of flow from the pressure drop. In real-time simulation of fluid power circuits, a trade-off exists between accuracy and calculation speed. This investigation is made for the two-regime flow orifice model. The effect of selection of transition pressure drop and integration time step on the accuracy and speed of solution is investigated. &copy; 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

For sheetmetal parts, when removed from dies after forming, are subject to springback due the resultant in-plane forces and moments throughout the sheet at the end of the forming processing. Therefore, springback should be compensated for integrating reverse engineering into the system of forming sheet metal with a complex surface. However, CAD modelling from measured points data is a roadblock to the automation of the duplication procedure. The difficulties here arise from surfaces fitting to measured points, which is well-known to be time-consuming. To avoid the roadblock, based on the convex hull property of B-spline, a new strategy for direct generation of die shapes from digitized points with springback compensation is presented in this paper. The proposed algorithm has been applied to a part of complicated geometry with good results. &copy; Springer-Verlag London Limited 2006.},

Constraints on manipulators' kinematics were transferred to constraints on control points of B-splines, and genetic algorithm was exploited to globally minimize the integral of squared jerk and seek the according optimal time nodes, then smoothness-optimal trajectories were generated, and problems lied in the existing methods including taking no attention to jerk accumulation and constraints on kinematics or traveling time were solved. Experimental results show that, trajectories generated by the proposed planner have the advantages of continuous and minimum accumulative jerk, and can decrease trajectory tracking errors effectively comparing to the existing cubic spline trajectories.},

The system considered is general and non-Gaussian and the tracking objective is the statistical information of a given target probability density function (pdf), rather than a deterministic signal. The control aims at making the statistical information of the output pdfs to follow those of a target pdf. For such a control framework, a variable structure adaptive tracking control strategy is first established using two-step neural network models. Following the B-spline neural network approximation to the integrated performance function, the concerned problem is transferred into the tracking of given weights. The dynamic neural network (DNN) is employed to identify the unknown nonlinear dynamics between the control input and the weights related to the integrated function. To achieve the required control objective, an adaptive controller based on the proposed DNN is developed so as to track a reference trajectory. Stability analysis for both the identification and tracking errors is developed via the use of Lyapunov stability criterion. Simulations are given to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach. &copy; 2009 IEEE.},

The creation of complex NURBS in design environments is a tedious process because very few tools exist, that allow a designer to design intuitively in real-time. Standard input devices such as the mouse and the keyboard do not provide the designer with direct and easy capabilities for surface manipulation. We have developed a NURBS modeling system that allows the designer to edit NURBS surfaces in realtime using a pressure sensitive sculpting/molding input device designed to be worn as a glove called the ModelGlove. This input device is equipped with force and position sensors for quantifying touch and intent of the designer. A virtual block deforms in a physically realistic manner in response to the user's direct manipulation of a hard or soft real physical object. The dynamic behavior of the NURBS model in response to the force and position input obtained from the ModelGlove, produces highly natural shape variations. Experimental results show the potential of the system for product and concept design applications.},

  abstract  = {The purpose of the paper is to describe the technical details of a numerical method that combines the cubic-spline representation of spatial variables in a finite domain with the logistics of the spectral transform method for the time integration of nonlinear meteorological equations. The reason for developing the method lies in its application to two-way interacting nested models of the atmosphere. When compared with the gridpoint representation, the cubic-spline representation allows direct evaluation of derivatives in the model equations, and leads to a substantial reduction of shortwave dispersion of advecting and propagating waves. When compared with the Fourier spectral representation, the cubic B-splines as basis functions provide simple but exact means of implementing a variety of boundary conditions that are needed at the domain interfaces, as well as at natural boundaries. A sharp (sixth order) low-pass filter, which is built into the cubic-spline transform, effectively eliminates adverse nonlinear accumulation of small-scale errors near the resolution limit. These features, critically important to noise-free nesting, are defined and analyzed in this paper in the simpler context of a single ID domain. The actual procedures for two-way interactive nesting will be presented in a subsequent paper.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents a parameterization and an interpolation method for quintic splines, which result in a smooth and consistent feed rate profile. The discrepancy between the spline parameter and the actual arc length leads to undesirable feed fluctuations and discontinuity, which elicit themselves as high frequency acceleration and jerk harmonics, causing unwanted structural vibrations and excessive tracking error. Two different approaches are presented that alleviate this problem. The first approach is based on modifying the spline tool path so that it is optimally parameterized with respect to its arc length, which allows it to be accurately interpolated in real-time with minimal complexity. The second approach is based on scheduling the spline parameter to accurately yield the desired arc displacement (hence feed rate), either by approximation of the relationship between the arc length and the spline parameter with a feed correction polynomial, or by solving the spline parameter iteratively in real-time at each interpolation step. This approach is particularly suited for predetermined spline tool paths, which are not arc-length parameterized and cannot be modified. The proposed methods have been compared to approximately arc-length C<sup>3</sup> quintic spline parameterization (Wang, F.-C., Wright, P. K., Barsky, B. A., and Yang, D. C.

  abstract  = {Direct-drive linear reciprocating compressors offer numerous advantages over conventional counterparts which are usually driven by a rotary induction motor via crank shaft However, to ensure efficient and reliable operation under all conditions, it is essential that the motor current of the linear compressor follows a sinusoidal command profile with a frequency which matches the system resonant frequency. This paper describes a hybrid current controller for the linear compressors. It comprises a conventional proportional-integral (PI) controller, and a B-spline neural network compensator which is trained on-line and in real-time in order to minimize the current tracking error under all conditions with uncertain disturbances. It has been shown that the hybrid current controller has a superior steady-state and transient performance over the conventional carrier based PI controller. The performance of the proposed hybrid controller has been demonstrated by extensive simulations and experiments. It has also been shown that the linear compressor operates stably under the current feedback control and the piston stroke can be adjusted by varying the amplitude of the current command. &copy; 2007 IEEE.},

In this procedure, no velocity parameters are used, so the selection of a suitable velocity background model is not necessary in the area with complex geological bodies. Another characteristic of this method is the ability to solve the discordance between travel time data and elevation data which always occurs while using conventional interpretation method and ensure the depths of geological surfaces transformed from seismic data full coinciding with those from original drilling data. &copy; 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Higher order spatial and temporal discretization schemes are applied to the boundary integral equations of the elastodynamic system yielding a time marching solution for the characteristic response of the system due to an excitation with a B-spline distribution in time. This characteristic response due to a B-spline excitation forms the basis, within the framework of a general B-spline superposition scheme, for the calculation of the responses of the same elastodynamic system due to any transient forcing function.},

In the case of an FIR (finite-impulse-response) digital filter, it has been found that a B-spline representation of the filter response leads to minimal time and circuit complexities. The number of filter coefficients required in this implementation is reduced and corresponds to the lower sampling rate of the filter function. The aliasing usually associated with this lower sampling rate is substantially reduced by processing the input data with a prefilter which can be interpreted as an interpolator. The prefilter is implemented using a cascade of running average filters which requires no multipliers. The B-spline approach is suited to VLSI implementation and leads to substantial reductions in circuit complexity.},

  abstract  = {The purpose of this research has been to develop and evaluate procedures for the mathematical modeling of hull forms. This has been accomplished through the application and integration of high-level computer graphics technology into the design process. High-level computer graphics are characterized by the ability to manipulate a realistically rendered image of a three-dimensional object, with a colored and shaded surface, in real time. The hull forms studied are appropriate to hard chine and round bilge small craft. The first interactive graphics program has been developed for the definition of developable hull surfaces such as the hard chine hull. Control curves, including the keel chine and sheer lines, are faired interactively through real-time graphical techniques on the workstation using the Curve Fairing Tool (CFT) program. A developable surface is then generated between the control curves using the Developable surface Definition Tool (DSDT). B-spline mathematical techniques have been found to be particularly useful for defining complex three-dimensional sculpted surfaces, such as the round bilge hull. A second interactive graphics program, SPLINE, has been developed which facilitates the interactive definition of the B-spline control graph and real-time manipulation of the model image. Finally, a technique has been developed for in situ measurements of an existing hull form which might serve for example, as a 'parent' for further development using either DSDT or SPLINE. The procedure is based on the use of laser light striping techniques to illuminate surface contours, in conjunction with video image recording. A processing procedure then applies inverse homogeneous coordinate transformations to obtain the planar contour coordinates which are used to define the surface geometry. This research is being conducted at the Computer-Aided Design Technology (CADTECH) research laboratory in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Washington.},

The described procedure results in a symmetrical structure of the impedance matrix, which allows the application of symmetric solvers with the benefit of a very effective solving procedure. Due to the choice of the expansion and weighting functions the results are very precise for near-fields and points near the structure. It become possible to investigate structures with very small separations between the wires. Numerical examples demonstrate the suitability of the method for the EMC-analysis and show the advantages of a reduced solving time in the analysis of large systems and a lower limit for the shortest separation between two wires.},

This transformation is justified because Bezier patches are numerically more stable than NURBS surfaces. The PO integral is evaluated over the parametric space of the Bezier surfaces using asymptotic integration. The scattering field contribution of each Bezier patch is expressed in terms of its geometric parameters. Excellent agreement with PO predictions is obtained. The method is quite efficient because it makes use of a small number of patches to model complex bodies, so it requires very little memory and computing time.},

We assume that the input x belongs to a class C of signals generated by a linear dynamical system, characterized by an m<sup>th</sup> order linear differential operator L(D), D = d/dt, driven by inputs of bounded energy. On this basis, we obtain the best discrete-time approximation F* to the analog filter F by interpolating the samples x(t<sub>1</sub>),...,x(t<sub>n</sub>) of x(t) by a generalized L-spline S(t) (corresponding to the differential operator L(D)), and then convolving S(t) with the impulse response of the analog filter F.

The motion of the droplet is coupled with the motion of the component or chip to be assembled and involves dynamic contact lines. A methodology based on a Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) discretization has been developed for the dynamic analysis of the droplet motion. A surface energy based formulation has been developed to incorporate the surface tension effects. The developed methodology leads to an updated Lagrangian scheme with a Galerkin in space and Least square in time formulation. The Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) representation used for the spatial discretization enables the method to handle problems involving complex droplet geometries. The ability of the NURBS representation to provide both global and local control, along with the least square method used in this methodology, enables us to develop an unconditionally stable time integration scheme which can be optimized to achieve desired accuracy and numerical dissipation efficiently. A sample problem of droplet shape evolution has been solved to demonstrate the path prediction capability of the proposed methodology. In future, the method can be applied to solve various real world dynamic motion problems associated with droplets.},

  abstract  = {Spline functions are used in the computation of several heat conduction and boundary layer problems. Three types of spline representations were investigated using both collation and integral methods of solution. The difficulties to be expected in problem formulation, computer programming, ill-conditioning of the matrices, and computational times and accuracies are discussed for the various representations and methods. The B-spline basis was concluded to be superior when used in collocation methods. Splines are not competitive with finite-difference methods for many problems, but will be advantageous in situations where computer storage must be minimized. A discussion of two-dimensional spline representations is included.},

  abstract   = {This paper deals with a new explicit framework for numerical dynamic analysis that could be applied to any explicit-implicit time integration, i.e. predictor-corrector time integrations. For this purpose, Dynamic Relaxation method is combined with the explicit-implicit time integrations so that the proposed algorithm is performed by full vector operations. This subject helps to obtain an explicit algorithm, which does not involve solving simultaneous system of equations in each time increment, even linear one. Moreover, the number of corrections, which is the main concern in the explicit-implicit algorithms, is selected automatically in the suggested procedure. Afterwards, some numerical examples are solved to illustrate the validity and the robustness of the proposed algorithm. Results show that applying the proposed framework to the higher order explicit-implicit integrations exhibits excellent accuracy in comparison with the well-known implicit Newmark-beta and Wilson-theta schemes. Simplicity, more stable integration, automated procedure and vector operations are some of the salient features of the proposed algorithm. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {A numerical model to deal with nonlinear elastodynamics involving large rotations within the framework of the finite element based on NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline) basis is presented. A comprehensive kinematical description using a corotational approach and an orthogonal tensor given by the exact polar decomposition is adopted. The state equation is written in terms of corotational variables according to the hypoelastic theory, relating the Jaumann derivative of the Cauchy stress to the Eulerian strain rate.The generalized- method (G) method and Generalized Energy-Momentum Method with an additional parameter (GEMM+) are employed in order to obtain a stable and controllable dissipative time-stepping scheme with algorithmic conservative properties for nonlinear dynamic analyses.The main contribution is to show that the energy-momentum conservation properties and numerical stability may be improved once a NURBS-based FEM in the spatial discretization is used. Also it is shown that high continuity can postpone the numerical instability when GEMM+ with consistent mass is employed; likewise, increasing the continuity class yields a decrease in the numerical dissipation. A parametric study is carried out in order to show the stability and energy budget in terms of several properties such as continuity class, spectral radius and lumped as well as consistent mass matrices.

On the basis of dynamic equilibrium, the governing differential equation of motion is obtained and converted to its corresponding weak form. B-spline functions are then utilized to approximate the weak form and to obtain the final matrix form of the problem. Finally, by applying essential boundary conditions, the natural frequencies and corresponding mode shapes are calculated.

  abstract = {We present in this paper the formulation of a new high-frequency dissipative time-stepping algorithm for nonlinear elastodynamics that is second-order accurate in time. The new scheme exhibits unconditional energy dissipation and momentum conservation (and thus the given name of energy-dissipative, momentum-conserving second-order scheme (EDMC-2)), leading also to the conservation of the relative equilibria of the underlying physical system. The unconditional character of these properties applies not only with respect to the time step size but, equally important, with respect to the considered elastic potential. Moreover, the dissipation properties are fully controlled through an algorithmic parameter, reducing to existing fully conserving schemes, if desired. The design of the new algorithm is described in detail, including a complete analysis of its dissipation/conservation properties in the fully nonlinear range of finite elasticity. To motivate the different constructions that lead to the dissipative properties of the final scheme, the same arguments are used first in the construction of new linear time-stepping algorithms for the system of linear elastodynamics, including first- and second-order schemes. The new schemes exhibit a rigorous decay of the physical energy, with the second-order schemes formulated in a general two-stage formula accommodating the aforementioned control parameter in the dissipation of the energy. A complete spectral analysis of the new schemes is presented in this linear range to evaluate their different numerical properties. In particular, the dissipative character of the proposed schemes in the high-frequency range is fully demonstrated. In fact, it is shown that the new second-order scheme is L-stable. Most remarkably, the extension of these ideas to the nonlinear range is accomplished avoiding the use of multi-stage formulae, given the freedom gained in using general nonlinear relations, while preserving the conservation laws of the momenta and the corresponding relative equilibria. Several representative numerical simulations are presented in the context of nonlinear elastodynamics to evaluate the performance of the newly proposed schemes. },

  abstract = {Incomplete field formulations have recently been the subject of intense research because of their potential in coupled analysis of independently modeled substructures, adaptive refinement, domain decomposition and parallel processing. This paper presents a spectral stability theory for the differential/algebraic dynamic systems associated with these formulations, discusses the design and analysis of suitable time-integration algorithms, and emphasizes the treatment of the inter-subdomain linear constraint equations. These constraints are shown to introduce a destabilizing effect in the dynamic system that can be analyzed by investigating the behavior of the time-integration algorithm at infinite and zero frequencies. Three different approaches for constructing penalty-free unconditionally stable second-order accurate solution procedures for this class of hybrid formulations are presented, analyzed and illustrated with numerical examples. In particular, the advantages of the Hilber-Hughes-Taylor (HHT) method and its generalized version (Generalized cu) are highlighted. The family of problems discussed in this paper can also be viewed as model problems for the more general case of hybrid formulations with non-linear constraints. For example, it is shown numerically in this paper that the theoretical results predicted by the spectral stability theory also apply to non-linear multibody dynamics formulations. Therefore, some of the algorithms outlined in this work are important alternatives to the popular technique consisting of transforming differential/algebraic equations into ordinary differential equations via the introduction of a stabilization term that depends on arbitrary constants, and that influences the computed solution.},

  abstract  = {An explicit pseudodynamic algorithm is preferred over an implicit pseudodynamic algorithm since it involves no iteration procedure or extra hardware that is usually needed for an implicit pseudodynamic algorithm. However, its size of time step is often strictly constrained by stability. Therefore, it seems promising if an explicit pseudodynamic algorithm can have unconditional stability, which will eliminate the severe limitation on a time step for the pseudodynamic testing of a multiple degree of freedom system or a substructure system. Although an unconditionally stable explicit pseudodynamic algorithm (USEPA-1) has been developed by the first author an enhanced unconditionally stable explicit pseudodynamic algorithm (USEPA-2) is further proposed. It is interesting to find that both algorithms have exactly the same numerical properties. However, USEPA-2 possesses better error propagation properties than those of USEPA-1.},

  abstract  = {In the step-by-step solution of a linear elastic system, an appropriate time step can be selected based on analytical evaluation results. However, there is no way to select an appropriate time step for accurate integration of a nonlinear system. In this study, numerical properties of the Newmark explicit method are analytically evaluated after introducing the instantaneous degree of nonlinearity. It is found that the upper stability limit is equal to 2 only for a linear elastic system. In general, it reduces for instantaneous stiffness hardening and it is enlarged for instantaneous stiffness softening. Furthermore, the absolute relative period error increases with the increase of instantaneous degree of nonlinearity for a given product of the natural frequency and the time step. The rough guidelines for accurate integration of a nonlinear system are also proposed in this paper based on the analytical evaluation results. Analytical evaluation results and the feasibility of the rough guidelines proposed for accurate integration of a nonlinear system are confirmed with numerical examples.},

Thus, it is very promising for the pseudodynamic testing of a system where high frequency responses are of no interest. This is because that favorable numerical dissipation can suppress the spurious growth of high frequency responses, which might arise from numerical and/or experimental errors during a test. Furthermore, the implementation of an explicit method for the pseudodynamic testing is much simpler than for an implicit method. The superiority of using this method in performing a pseudodynamic test was verified both analytically and experimentally. In fact, results of error propagation analysis reveal that the spurious growth of high frequency responses can be suppressed and less error propagation is identified when compared to the Newmark explicit method. Actual tests were conducted pseudodynamically to confirm all the analytical results. It is also illustrated that although the high frequency response is insignificant to the total response it may be significantly amplified and propagated and finally destroys the pseudodynamic test results.},

However, its performance for nonlinear systems is unclear due to a lack of analytical evaluation techniques. Thus, a novel technique is proposed herein to evaluate its efficiency for application to nonlinear systems by introducing two parameters to describe the stiffness change. As a result, the numerical properties and error propagation characteristics of the $\gamma$-function explicit method for the pseudodynamic testing of a nonlinear system are analytically assessed. It is found that the upper stability limit decreases as the step degree of nonlinearity increases; and it increases as the current degree of nonlinearity increases. It is also shown that this integration method provides favorable numerical dissipation not only for linear elastic systems but also for nonlinear systems. Furthermore, error propagation analysis reveals that the numerical dissipation can effectively suppress the severe error propagation of high frequency modes while the low frequency responses are almost unaffected for both linear elastic and nonlinear systems.},

  abstract = {Two important extensions of a technique to perform a nonlinear error propagation analysis for an explicit pseudodynamic algorithm (Chang, 2003) are presented. One extends the stability study from a given time step to a complete step-by-step integration procedure. It is analytically proven that ensuring stability conditions in each time step leads to a stable computation of the entire step-by-step integration procedure. The other extension shows that the nonlinear error propagation results, which are derived for a nonlinear single degree of freedom (SDOF) system, can be applied to a nonlinear multiple degree of freedom (MDOF) system. This application is dependent upon the determination of the natural frequencies of the system in each time step, since all the numerical properties and error propagation properties in the time step are closely related to these frequencies. The results are derived from the step degree of nonlinearity. An instantaneous degree of nonlinearity is introduced to replace the step degree of nonlinearity and is shown to be easier to use in practice. The extensions can be also applied to the results derived from a SDOF system based on the instantaneous degree of nonlinearity, and hence a time step might be appropriately chosen to perform a pseudodynamic test prior to testing.},

Its unconditional stability is verified only for linear elastic systems, while for nonlinear systems, instability occurs as the step degree of convergence is less than 1. It is worth noting that the step degree of convergence can frequently be less than 1 in pseudodynamic testing, since a convergent solution is achieved only when the step degree of convergence is close to 1 regardless of whether its value is greater or less than 1. Therefore, the application of this scheme to pseudodynamic testing should be prohibited, since the possibility of instability might incorrectly destroy a specimen. Consequently, the implementation of the HHT $\alpha$ method by using the difference equation to determine the next step acceleration is recommended for use in pseudodynamic testing.},

Their numerical properties in the solution of a linear elastic system have been well explored and their applications to the pseudodynamic testing of a nonlinear system have been shown to be feasible. However, their numerical properties in the solution of a nonlinear system are not apparent. Therefore, the performance of both algorithms for use in the solution of a nonlinear system has been analytically evaluated after introducing an instantaneous degree of nonlinearity. The two algorithms have roughly the same accuracy for a small value of the product of the natural frequency and step size. Meanwhile, the first algorithm is unconditionally stable when the instantaneous degree of nonlinearity is less than or equal to 1, and it becomes conditionally stable when it is greater than 1. The second algorithm is conditionally stable as the instantaneous degree of nonlinearity is less than 1/9, and becomes unstable when it is greater than 1. It can have unconditional stability for the range between 1/9 and 1. Based on these evaluations, it was concluded that the first algorithm is superior to the second one. Also, both algorithms were found to require commensurate computational efforts, which are much less than needed for the Newmark explicit method in general structural dynamic problems.},

   the numerical accuracy, including the accuracy associated with a linear

   incorporates the error in amplitude relative to the exact solution. This
   measure can reflect amplitude distortion more realistically in a
   numerical solution when compared to the current measures of numerical

   systems, any linear elastic systems, and certain instantaneous stiffness
   hardening systems that might be experienced in a realistic structure.

   to an impulse by using the Duhamel integral method for a single
   degree-of-freedom system, it is analytically verified herein that an
   extra amplitude distortion will be introduced at the end of the impulse
   by using the Newmark method. In fact, the relative amplitude error in
   the displacement response due to the discontinuity at the end of the
   impulse can be reliably estimated by the ratio of the area of extra
   impulse over the area of input impulse, where the area of extra impulse
   is equal to a half of the product of the time step and load
   discontinuity. It seems that the momentum equation of motion can be used
   to easily overcome the discontinuity problem at the end of an impulse.
   This is because the external force is replaced by its corresponding
   external momentum, which is obtained from the time integration of
   external force, and thus the discontinuity problem automatically
   disappears by using the momentum equation of motion. Numerical studies
   reveal that this technique is applicable to nonlinear systems.
   Meanwhile, it is also numerically illustrated that the discontinuity
   problem can be overcome by performing a very small time step immediately
   upon termination of the applied impulse. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All

   addition, this extra impulse is proportional to the discontinuity value

   overcome this difficulty, an effective approach is proposed to reduce
   the extra impulse and hence the extra displacement. In fact, the novel
   approach proposed in this paper is to perform a single small time step
   immediately upon the termination of applied impulse, whereas other time
   steps can be conducted by using the step size determined from accuracy
   consideration in period. The feasibility of this approach is
   analytically explored. Further, analytical results are confirmed by

   pseudodynamic testing of nonlinear systems with high frequency modes has
   been conducted and thus unconditional stability for nonlinear systems
   was indicated, there is still lack of an analytical proof. In order to
   explore the nonlinear performance of this explicit pseudodynamic
   algorithm, a new parameter of instantaneous degree of nonlinearity is
   introduced to monitor the stiffness change between the stiffness at the
   end of a time step and the initial stiffness. This parameter enables
   basic analysis and error propagation analysis for a nonlinear system. In
   addition, it can also be applied to construct the rough guidelines to
   select an appropriate time step to conduct a pseudodynamic test although
   it is almost impossible to achieve this goal using the currently
   available techniques for a nonlinear system. Analytical results reveal
   that this algorithm can have unconditional stability for instantaneous
   stiffness softening and linear elastic systems while it has conditional
   stability for instantaneous stiffness hardening systems. The proposed

  abstract                   = {{An implementation for the pseudodynamic testing of a one-story frame
   subject to bidirectional loading was proposed and its feasibility was
   experimentally verified. Three generalized degrees of freedom at the
   center of mass of the roof diaphragm are often used in formulating the
   equations of motion for the one-story frame in a nonplanar test. In this
   work, three loading points of actuators oriented in the original
   directions of these actuators were selected to formulate equations of
   motion. Since loading-point degrees of freedom instead of generalized
   degrees of freedom were used for a pseudodynamic test there is no need
   to construct the transformation between these two coordinate systems.
   Thus, there is no error propagation regarding these transformations.
   External displacement transducers were applied to measure the
   displacement components along the original directions of the actuators
   although the directions of these actuators may vary after the specimen
   deforms. This displacement measurement is easy to implement and saves a
   large space in the test setup. A series of pseudodynamic tests were
   performed and the responses were compared to shaking table tests. These
   test results attested to that a bidirectional pseudodynamic test can be
   conducted using the loading-point degrees of freedom and this technique
   is applicable to the three-dimensional testing of structures under
   multiple components of earthquake ground motion.}},

   shock response. The only change is the loading input at the time instant
   of load discontinuity in performing the step-by-step integration. The
   average value of the two discontinuity values at the integration point
   of load discontinuity is used to replace the use of one of them for
   loading input. The motivation of this change originates from the concept
   of no loading input error associated with the integration point of load
   discontinuity. The feasibility of this scheme is analytically explored.
   Analytical results reveal that this change in loading input will lead to
   no extra impulse and thus no extra displacement. Consequently, an
   accurate shock response can be computationally efficiently obtained. Two
   numerical examples are also used to confirm the analytical results. The
   scheme proposed will not increase any computational effort or complicate
   the dynamic analysis codes.}},

   of explicit methods of the explicitness of each time step and that of
   implicit methods of the possibility of unconditional stability, is
   presented herein. This algorithm is analytically shown to be
   unconditionally stable for any linear elastic and nonlinear systems
   except for the instantaneous stiffness hardening systems with the
   instantaneous degree of nonlinearity larger than 4/3 based on a
   linearized stability analysis. Hence, its stability property is better
   than the previously published algorithm (Chang, 2007, ``Improved
   Explicit Method for Structural Dynamics,{''} J. Eng. Mech., 133(7), pp.
   748-760), which is only conditionally stable for instantaneous stiffness
   hardening systems although it also possesses unconditional stability for
   linear elastic and any instantaneous stiffness softening systems. Due to
   the explicitness of each time step, the possibility of unconditional
   stability, and comparable accuracy, the proposed algorithm is very
   promising for a general structural dynamic problem, where only the low
   frequency responses are of interest since it consumes much less
   computational efforts when compared with explicit methods, such as the
   Newmark explicit method, and implicit methods, such as the constant

   Zienkiewicz can have unconditional stability and numerical dissipation
   for linear elastic systems. However, it is still unclear about its
   performance in the solution of nonlinear systems analytically. Hence,
   this study proposes to analytically investigate its numerical
   characteristics for solving nonlinear systems.
   Design/methodology/approach - Two parameters are introduced to
   facilitate the basic analysis for nonlinear systems. One is the step
   degree of nonlinearity, which describes the stiffness change within a
   time step, and the other is the step degree of convergence, which
   describes the convergence error due to an iteration procedure.
   Findings - It is theoretically proved that the sub-family of WBZ-alpha
   method of -1 <= alpha < 0, beta = (1/4)(1 - alpha)(2) and gamma = (1/2)
   - alpha is unconditionally stable and has desired numerical dissipation
   for any nonlinear systems even with the presence of convergence error.
   These theoretical results are confirmed by numerical examples.
   Originality/value - This analytical study reveals that the performance
   of the WBZ-alpha method for nonlinear systems is in general the same as
   that for linear elastic systems.}},

  abstract                   = {{Structure-dependent integration methods seem promising for structural
   dynamics applications since they can integrate unconditional stability
   and explicit formulation together, which can enable the integration
   methods to save many computational efforts when compared to an implicit
   method. A newly developed structure-dependent integration method can
   inherit such numerical properties. However, an unusual overshooting
   behavior might be experienced as it is used to compute a forced
   vibration response. The root cause of this inaccuracy is thoroughly
   explored herein. In addition, a scheme is proposed to modify this family
   method to overcome this unusual overshooting behavior. In fact, two
   improved formulations are proposed by adjusting the difference
   equations. As a result, it is verified that the two improved
   formulations of the integration methods can effectively overcome the
   difficulty arising from the inaccurate integration of the steady-state
   response of a high frequency mode.}},

   loading for an integration method is emphasized. In a step-by-step
   integration procedure, amplitude distortions in the transient and
   steady-state responses depend on the step discretization error of
   dynamic loading for each time step. Correlations between amplitude
   distortion and step discretization error for dynamic loadings are
   analytically established for a specified integration method. These
   correlations may be considered as the basic numerical properties in
   evaluating a step-by-step integration method. As a result, the
   superiority of the previously published algorithm (PPA) {[}S. Y. Chang,
   Int. J. Numer. Meth. Eng. 77(8) (2009) 1100-1120] over its modified form
   and the member of Newmark family method (MNM) with beta = gamma = 1/2 in
   capturing dynamic loading is analytically verified (even though the
   three algorithms have exactly the same characteristic equation).}},

   computational effort is involved. In this study, it will be shown that a
   significant amplitude distortion may also occur for a dynamic loading,

   to overcome the difficulty caused by the load discontinuity. This remedy
   is very simple and it involves adjusting the input load at the time
   instant of discontinuity. In fact, the average of the two discontinuity
   values at the load discontinuity is taken to be the adjusting input load
   for the time instant of load discontinuity. The feasibility of this
   remedy is analytically verified and confirmed with numerical examples

   basic analysis and error propagation analysis for the pseudodynamic
   testing of nonlinear systems, it cannot be reliably used to select an
   appropriate time step before performing a pseudodynamic test. Therefore,
   a novel parameter of instantaneous degree of nonlinearity is introduced
   to monitor the stiffness change at the end of a time step, and can thus
   be used to evaluate numerical and error propagation properties for
   nonlinear systems. Based on these properties, it is possible to select
   an appropriate time step to conduct a pseudodynamic test in advance.
   This possibility is very important in pseudodynamic testing, since the
   use of an arbitrary time step might lead to unreliable results or even
   destroy the test specimen. In this paper, guidelines are proposed for
   choosing an appropriate time step for accurate integration of nonlinear
   systems. These guidelines require estimation of the maximum
   instantaneous degree of nonlinearity and the solution of the initial
   natural frequency. The Newmark explicit method is chosen for this study.
   All the analytical results and the guidelines proposed are thoroughly
   confirmed with numerical examples.}},

  abstract                   = {{The gamma-function explicit method has been developed for pseudodynamic
   testing since it can have favorable numerical dissipation. This
   numerical dissipation originates from the use of the structure-dependent
   coefficient matrices in a quadrature equation. These coefficient
   matrices highly depend upon initial stiffness matrix, which is
   experimentally determined before the pseudodynamic test. Since the
   initial stiffness matrix determined from an experimental procedure may
   be different if a different displacement is imposed upon a specified
   degree of freedom to obtain its corresponding column, the coefficient
   matrices will vary accordingly. Sensitivity studies of this variation of
   the coefficient matrices for numerical properties and error propagation
   properties are conducted herein. It is revealed by both the analytical
   and numerical results that the performance of the gamma-function
   explicit pseudodynamic algorithm for both linear elastic and nonlinear
   systems is insensitive to the variation of the coefficient matrices in
   the quadrature equation, especially for a small value of the product of
   the natural frequency and the size of integration time step.}},

   stability and the explicitness of each time step simultaneously. For
   this purpose, a novel family of explicit methods, which can have
   unconditional stability, is developed and presented. For linear elastic
   systems, the numerical properties of the proposed family method are the
   same as the Newmark family method since they have the same
   characteristic equation. A subfamily of this family can have
   unconditional stability for linear elastic systems. However, the most
   important properties of this subfamily are unconditional stability for
   nonlinear systems, and comparable accuracy when compared to second-order
   accurate methods, such as the Newmark explicit method and constant
   average acceleration method. Hence, this subfamily might be very useful
   for general structural dynamic problems, where the response is dominated
   by low frequency modes only. This is because that the unconditional
   stability and comparable accuracy allow the use of a large time step,
   and the explicitness of each time step involves no iterative procedure.
   As a result, many computational efforts can be saved.}},

   from an impulse might encounter a difficulty caused by a significant
   load discontinuity at the end of the impulse since this load
   discontinuity at the end of an impulse will result in an extra impulse
   and then an extra amplitude distortion. This extra impulse is linearly
   proportional to the step size and thus it is natural to consider the use
   of a very small time step for a whole pseudodynamic test to overcome the
   difficulty. However, a series of computer simulations reveal that this
   approach might not be feasible. This is because that the use of a small
   time step will lead to a very small displacement increment and it may be
   contaminated by experimental errors as its magnitude is less than or
   close to the magnitude of the experimental errors Thus, an inaccurate
   test result is obtained. A technique is proposed to overcome this
   difficulty. This novel technique is to perform a single small time step
   immediately upon the termination of the applied impulse while the other
   time steps are conducted by using the time step determined from general
   considerations. This single small time step will not lead to a
   significant error propagation problem since only this time step is
   performed by using a very small step size for a complete pseudodynamic
   test. The feasibility of this technique was confirmed by a series of
   pseudodynamic tests.}},

   responses from impulses is studied herein. A direct integration method
   is often used to solve the force equation of motion in performing a
   conventional pseudodynamic test. However, this technique might not be
   applicable to obtain an accurate shock response from an impulse as a
   load discontinuity occurs at the end of the impulse. This is because
   this discontinuity will lead to an extra amplitude distortion and the
   amount of this amplitude distortion is increased with the increase of
   time step. Hence, a small time step is needed to reduce the extra
   amplitude distortion and thus the displacement increment for each time
   step might be smaller than or as small as the resolution of the
   displacement transducer. As a result, the displacement increment cannot
   be accurately imposed upon the specimen and the responses will be
   contaminated by the noise. In addition, the test duration is drastically
   increased. Alternatively, this difficulty might be overcome if the
   momentum equation of motion instead of the force equation of motion is
   solved pseudodynamically. Hence, an external momentum is used in the
   solution of the momentum equation of motion. Since the external momentum
   is a resultant of the time integration of the external force the
   discontinuity problem will automatically disappear. Consequently,
   reliable shock responses can be obtained from pseudodynamic tests.}},

   an integration method is usually constructed from a whole step-by-step
   integration procedure for linear elastic systems. In this paper, a
   technique based on linearized analysis is proposed to evaluate the
   numerical properties of a step-by-step integration method for each time
   step for both linear and nonlinear systems. For this purpose, two
   parameters are introduced for each time step. One is used to describe
   the degree of nonlinearity ( DON) and the other is employed to monitor
   the degree of convergence (DOC) as an iteration procedure is used. It
   seems that the proposed evaluation technique can reliably predict the
   numerical properties of an integration method in the solution of
   nonlinear systems. Furthermore, a guideline to have accurate solutions
   of nonlinear systems is proposed and confirmed with numerical examples.
   Although the evaluation technique is conducted on a time step, it is
   still indicative for a complete integration procedure since this
   procedure consists of each time step. It is verified that the constant
   average acceleration method (CAAM) is spectrally stable for nonlinear
   systems in a whole integration procedure based on a linearized stability

   to analytically explore the performance of numerical dissipation in the

   introduced to evaluate the numerical and error propagation properties of
   the gamma-function explicit method for nonlinear systems. It is
   analytically and numerically verified that this method has favorable
   numerical dissipation not only for linear elastic but also nonlinear
   systems. In fact, the suppression of high frequency modes for nonlinear
   systems is analytically proved. The importance of the spectral radius
   for a nonlinear system is also addressed. The rate of suppression of the
   spurious growth of high frequency responses will be accelerated due to
   stiffness hardening while it is decelerated due to stiffness softening.}},

  abstract             = {In real-time hybrid simulations (RTHS) that utilize explicit integration
   algorithms, the inherent damping in the analytical substructure is
   generally defined using mass and initial stiffness proportional damping.
   This type of damping model is known to produce inaccurate results when
   the structure undergoes significant inelastic deformations. To alleviate
   the problem, a form of a nonproportional damping model often used in
   numerical simulations involving implicit integration algorithms can be
   considered. This type of damping model, however, when used with explicit
   integration algorithms can require a small time step to achieve the
   desired accuracy in an RTHS involving a structure with a large number of
   degrees of freedom. Restrictions on the minimum time step exist in an
   RTHS that are associated with the computational demand. Integrating the
   equations of motion for an RTHS with too large of a time step can result
   in spurious high-frequency oscillations in the member forces for
   elements of the structural model that undergo inelastic deformations.
   The problem is circumvented by introducing the parametrically
   controllable numerical energy dissipation available in the recently
   developed unconditionally stable explicit KR- method. This paper reviews
   the formulation of the KR- method and presents an efficient
   implementation for RTHS. Using the method, RTHS of a three-story
   0.6-scale prototype steel building with nonlinear elastomeric dampers
   are conducted with a ground motion scaled to the design basis and
   maximum considered earthquake hazard levels. The results show that
   controllable numerical energy dissipation can significantly eliminate
   spurious participation of higher modes and produce exceptional RTHS
   results. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

   First, we introduce a new unconditional stability criterion. Then, by

   explicit and unconditionally stable solutions for quasi-static

   explicit target displacement but not an explicit target velocity, so
   that it is essentially an implicit method for real-time substructure
   testing (RST) when the velocity-dependent restoring force is considered.
   This paper proposes a target velocity formulation based on the forward
   difference of the predicted displacements so as to render the OSM
   explicit for RST. The stability and accuracy of the resulting OSM-RST
   algorithm are investigated. It is shown that the OSM-RST is
   unconditionally stable so long as the non-linear stiffness and damping
   are of the softening type (i.e. the tangent stiffness and damping never
   exceed the initial values). The stability of the OSM-RST for structures
   with infinite tangent damping coefficient or stiffness is also proved,
   and the stability of the method for MDOF structures with a non-classical
   damping matrix is demonstrated by an energy criterion. The effects of
   actuator delay and compensation are analysed based on the bilinear
   approximation of the actuator step response. Experiments on damped SDOF
   and MDOF structures verify that the stability of the OSM-RST is
   preserved when the experimental substructure generates

   That algorithm has been shown, in the absence of damping or other energy
   dissipation, to exhibit instability over narrow timestep ranges that
   become narrower as the number of degrees of freedom increases, making
   them unlikely to be encountered in practice. The present algorithm
   avoids such instabilities in the case of a one to two timestep ratio
   (two subcycles), achieving unconditional stability in an exponential
   sense for a linear problem. However, with three or more subcycles, the
   trapezoidal rule exhibits stability that becomes conditional, falling
   towards that of the central difference method as the number of subcycles
   increases. Instabilities over narrow timestep ranges, that become
   narrower as the model size increases, also appear with three or more

   timestep these the unstable timestep ranges become extremely narrow,

   is improved. Use of a version of the Newmark algorithm that dissipates

   investigate the stability of direct integration algorithms for nonlinear

   large-scale steel structure with nonlinear viscous dampers. The test
   structure includes a three-story, single-bay moment-resisting frame
   (MRF), a three-story, single-bay frame with a nonlinear viscous damper
   and associated bracing in each story (called damped braced frame (DBF)),
   and gravity load system with associated seismic mass and gravity loads.
   To achieve the accurate RTHS results presented in this paper, several
   factors were considered comprehensively: (1) different arrangements of
   substructures for the RTHS; (2) dynamic characteristics of the test
   setup; (3) accurate integration of the equations of motion; (4)
   continuous movement of the servo-controlled hydraulic actuators; (5)
   appropriate feedback signals to control the RTHS; and (6) adaptive
   compensation for potential control errors. Unlike most previous RTHS
   studies, where the actuator stroke was used as the feedback to control
   the RTHS, the present study uses the measured displacements of the
   experimental substructure as the feedback for the RTHS, to enable
   accurate displacements to be imposed on the experimental substructure.
   This improvement in approach was needed because of compliance and other
   dynamic characteristics of the test setup, which will be present in most
   large-scale RTHS. RTHS with ground motions at the design basis
   earthquake and maximum considered earthquake levels were successfully
   performed, resulting in significant nonlinear response of the test
   structure, which makes accurate RTHS more challenging. Two phases of
   RTHS were conducted: in the first phase, the DBF is the experimental
   substructure, and in the second phase, the DBF together with the MRF is
   the experimental substructure. The results from the two phases of RTHS
   are presented and compared with numerical simulation results. An
   evaluation of the results shows that the RTHS approach used in this
   study provides a realistic and accurate simulation of the seismic
   response of a large-scale structure with rate-dependent energy

  abstract                   = {{Real-time hybrid testing (RTHT) involves virtual splitting of the
   structure into two parts: physical substructure that contains the key
   region of interest which is tested in a laboratory and numerical
   substructure that contains the remaining part of the structure in the
   form of a numerical model. This paper numerically assesses four
   step-by-step integration methods (Central difference method (CDM),
   Operator splitting method (OSM), Rosenbrock based method (RBM) and
   CR-integration method (CR)) which are widely used in RTHT. The methods
   have been assessed in terms of stability and accuracy for various
   realistic damping ratios of the physical substructure. The stability is
   assessed in terms of the spectral radii of the amplification matrix
   while the accuracy in terms of numerical damping and period distortion.
   In order to evaluate the performance of the methods, five carefully
   chosen examples have been studied - undamped SDOF, damped SDOF,
   instantaneous softening, instantaneous hardening and hysteretic system.
   The performance of the methods is measured in terms of a non-dimensional
   error index for displacement and velocity. Based on the error indices,
   it is observed that OSM and RBM are robust and performs fairly well in
   all the cases. CDM performed well for undamped SDOF system. CR method
   can be used for the system showing softening behaviour. The error
   indices indicate that accuracy of OSM is more than other method in case
   of hysteretic system. The accuracy of the results obtained through time
   integration methods for different damping ratios of the physical
   substructure is addressed in the present study. In the presence of a
   number of integration methods, it is preferable to have criteria for the
   selection of the time integration scheme. As such criteria are not
   available presently, this paper attempts to fill this gap by numerically
   assessing the four commonly used step-by-step methods.}},

   Real-time hybrid simulation (RTHS) is conducted to perform the

   substructure of the RTHS is a 10-m tall planar steel frame equipped with
   a large-scale MR damper. Through RTHS, the test configuration is used to
   represent two code-compliant structures, and is evaluated under seismic
   excitation. The results from numerical simulation and RTHS are compared
   to verify the RTHS methodology. The global responses of the full system
   are used to assess the performance of each control algorithm. In each
   case, the reduction in peak and root mean square (RMS) responses
   (displacement, drift, acceleration, damper force, etc.) is examined.
   Beyond the verification tests, the robust performance of the damper
   controllers is also demonstrated using RTHS. (C) 2014 American Society

   methodology for testing integrated structural systems with
   rate-dependent behaviors. Within a RTHS implementation, critical
   components of the structural system under evaluation are physically
   tested, while more predictable components are replaced with
   computational models under a one-to-one timescale execution. As a
   result, RTHS implementations provide a more economical and versatile
   alternate approach to evaluating structural/rate-dependent systems under
   actual dynamic and inertial conditions, without the need for full-scale
   structural testing. One significant challenge in RTHS is the accurate
   representation of the physical complexities within the computational
   counterparts. For RTHS, the requirement for computational environments
   with reliable modeling and real-time execution capabilities is critical.
   Additionally, the need of a flexible environment for implementation and
   easy integration of such platforms with remaining RTHS components has
   also been established. An open-source computational platform,
   RT-Frame2D, for the RTHS of dynamically excited steel frame structures
   has been developed to satisfy these demands. The computational platform
   includes both adequate modeling capabilities for the nonlinear dynamic
   analysis of steel frame structures under real-time execution, and a
   versatile design to allow its efficient integration within a RTHS
   framework. Comparisons of RT-Frame2D modeling capabilities with those of
   a well-known simulation tool, in addition to challenging experimental
   implementations based on several RTHS scenarios, are performed herein to
   verify the accuracy, stability, and real-time execution performance of
   the proposed computational platform.}},

   single frame-foundation structure are implemented where the foundation,

   powerful methodology to evaluate structural components and systems under
   realistic operating conditions. The concept of RTHS combines the
   advantages of both numerical analysis and physical laboratory testing.
   Furthermore, the enforced real-time execution condition enables testing
   of rate-dependent components. One of the most important challenges in
   RTHS is to achieve synchronized boundary conditions between
   computational and physical substructures. The level of synchronization,
   i.e., actuators tracking performance, largely governs RTHS test
   stability and accuracy. The objective of this study is to propose and
   validate a generalized procedure for multiple-degree-of-freedom (MDOF)
   RTHS. A loop-shaping H-infinity robust control design strategy is
   proposed to control the motion of the actuators. Validation experiments
   are performed successfully, including the challenges of multiple
   actuators dynamically coupled through a continuum steel moment resisting
   frame (MRF) specimen. The resulting framework is further utilized to
   evaluate the performance of a magnetorheological (MR) damper in its
   effectiveness to mitigate structural vibration when the structure is
   subjected to dynamic disturbances, e.g., earthquakes. (C) 2013 American

  abstract                   = {{Hydraulic actuators are typically used in a real-time hybrid simulation
   to impose displacements to a test structure (also known as the
   experimental substructure). It is imperative that good actuator control
   is achieved in the real-time hybrid simulation to minimize actuator
   delay that leads to incorrect simulation results. The inherent
   nonlinearity of an actuator as well as any nonlinear response of the
   experimental substructure can result in an amplitude-dependent behavior
   of the servo-hydraulic system, making it challenging to accurately
   control the actuator. To achieve improved control of a servo-hydraulic
   system with nonlinearities, an adaptive actuator compensation scheme
   called the adaptive time series (ATS) compensator is developed. The ATS
   compensator continuously updates the coefficients of the system transfer
   function during a real-time hybrid simulation using online real-time
   linear regression analysis. Unlike most existing adaptive methods, the
   system identification procedure of the ATS compensator does not involve
   user-defined adaptive gains. Through the online updating of the
   coefficients of the system transfer function, the ATS compensator can
   effectively account for the nonlinearity of the combined system,
   resulting in improved accuracy in actuator control. A comparison of the
   performance of the ATS compensator with existing linearized compensation
   methods shows superior results for the ATS compensator for cases
   involving actuator motions with predefined actuator displacement
   histories as well as real-time hybrid simulations. Copyright (c) 2013

  abstract                   = {{The equivalent force control (EFC) method has been developed for
   real-time substructure testing with implicit integration to replace the
   numerical iterative process with feedback control. This paper addresses
   two issues concerning the performance of this method. One is the
   determination of the force-displacement conversion factor (a key
   component of EFC) for nonlinear specimens. The analysis conducted here
   shows that the force-displacement conversion factor is largely governed
   by the properties of the numerical substructure and the numerical scheme
   when a small integration time interval is used. Otherwise, the factor
   has to be determined with the secant stiffness of the specimen and of
   the numerical substructure if a proportional-derivative controller is
   used for EFC. The other issue is the overshooting problem, which may
   arise for multidegree-of-freedom structures because of the relatively
   quick response feedback from the numerical substructure in the
   closed-loop EFC. This problem can be resolved by reducing either the EFC
   gains or the increment size of the equivalent force command. The
   analytical studies on these two issues are verified by numerical
   simulations and for real-time substructure tests conducted on structural
   models with buckling restrained braces. Furthermore, a real-time
   substructure test was conducted on an offshore platform with
   magnetorheological dampers in order to serve as an example of a
   practical application of the method. DOI:

  abstract                   = {{Real-time hybrid simulation is a viable experiment technique to evaluate
   the performance of structures equipped with rate-dependent seismic
   devices when subject to dynamic loading. The integration algorithm used
   to solve the equations of motion has to be stable and accurate to
   achieve a successful real-time hybrid simulation. The implicit HHT
   a-algorithm is a popular integration algorithm for conducting structural
   dynamic time history analysis because of its desirable properties of
   unconditional stability for linear elastic structures and controllable
   numerical damping for high frequencies. The implicit form of the
   algorithm, however, requires iterations for nonlinear structures, which
   is undesirable for real-time hybrid simulation. Consequently, the HHT
   a-algorithm has been implemented for real-time hybrid simulation using a
   fixed number of substep iterations. The resulting HHT a-algorithm with a
   fixed number of substep iterations is believed to be unconditionally
   stable for linear elastic structures, but research on its stability and
   accuracy for nonlinear structures is quite limited. In this paper, a
   discrete transfer function approach is utilized to analyze the HHT
   a-algorithm with a fixed number of substep iterations. The algorithm is
   shown to be unconditionally stable for linear elastic structures, but
   only conditionally stable for nonlinear softening or hardening
   structures. The equivalent damping of the algorithm is shown to be
   almost the same as that of the original HHT a-algorithm, while the
   period elongation varies depending on the structural nonlinearity and
   the size of the integration time-step. A modified form of the algorithm
   is proposed to improve its stability for use in nonlinear structures.
   The stability of the modified algorithm is demonstrated to be enhanced
   and have an accuracy that is comparable to that of the existing HHT
   a-algorithm with a fixed number of substep iterations. Both numerical
   and real-time hybrid simulations are conducted to verify the modified
   algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the

  abstract                   = {{Real-time hybrid simulation provides a viable method to experimentally
   evaluate the performance of structural systems subjected to earthquakes.
   The structural system is divided into substructures, where part of the
   system is modeled by experimental substructures, whereas the remaining
   part is modeled analytically. The displacements in a real-time hybrid
   simulation are imposed by servo-hydraulic actuators to the experimental
   substructures. Actuator delay compensation has been shown by numerous
   researchers to vitally achieve reliable real-time hybrid simulation
   results. Several studies have been performed on servo-hydraulic actuator
   delay compensation involving single experimental substructure with
   single actuator. Research on real-time hybrid simulation involving
   multiple experimental substructures, however, is limited. The effect of
   actuator delay during a real-time hybrid simulation with multiple
   experimental substructures presents challenges. The restoring forces
   from experimental substructures may be coupled to two or more degrees of
   freedom (DOF) of the structural system, and the delay in each actuator
   must be adequately compensated. This paper first presents a stability
   analysis of actuator delay for real-time hybrid simulation of a
   multiple-DOF linear elastic structure to illustrate the effect of
   coupled DOFs on the stability of the simulation. An adaptive
   compensation method then proposed for the stable and accurate control of
   multiple actuators for a real-time hybrid simulation. Real-time hybrid
   simulation of a two-story four-bay steel moment-resisting frame with
   large-scale magneto-rheological dampers in passive-on mode subjected to
   the design basis earthquake is used to experimentally demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the compensation method in minimizing actuator delay in
   multiple experimental substructures. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley \&

  abstract                   = {{The simulation in real time of heterogeneous systems has to guarantee
   that the time integration of the equations of motion is always
   successfully completed within an a priori fixed sampling time interval.
   Therefore, numerical and/or physical substructures as well as numerical
   solution methods have to be adapted to the needs of real-time
   simulations. Monolithic stable numerical methods are implicit and cannot
   be easily used in real-time applications because of their iterative
   strategies necessary to solve the nonlinear corrector equations. As an
   alternative, in the present paper, we consider linearly implicit
   Rosenbrock-based L-stable real-time (LSRT) compatible algorithms with
   both two-stage and three-stage. Moreover, other linearly implicit
   structural integrators used nowadays to perform coupled simulations in
   real time are introduced too. Successively, typical properties of
   monolithic algorithms are shown when large time steps are employed. The
   loss of stability and the reduction of accuracy of these algorithms,
   when applied to coupled systems caused by kinematically closed loops,
   are analyzed in-depth through a split-inertia substructured system. In
   this respect, the benefits of the L-stability property are shown.
   Finally, the performance of the algorithms under investigation appears
   in a number of more realistic tests considering both nonstiff and stiff
   substructures.}},

   discretized equations of motion to evaluate the performance of
   structures under dynamic loading. The stability of these direct
   integration algorithms are usually investigated for linear elastic
   structures. However integration algorithms are often applied to
   structures with nonlinear behavior. This paper presents a procedure
   based on discrete control theory to investigate the stability of direct
   integration algorithms applied to multidegree-of-freedom (MDOF)
   nonlinear structures. The discrete root locus approach is used to
   investigate properties of the poles of the discrete transfer function
   matrix representing the nonlinear structural dynamics and to assess the
   stability of the integration algorithm. The procedure is illustrated
   using a nonlinear shear building MDOF system to investigate the
   stability of popular direct integration algorithms, including the
   Newmark family of integration algorithms, the Hilber-Hughes-Taylor
   alpha-method, and two newly developed explicit integration algorithms.
   Stability limits are derived for the direct integration algorithms that
   are found to be conditionally stable.}},

Their stability diagrams and order stars show their A-stability for θ≥1/2, and L-stability in some cases. Order stars in the Riemann surface are a requirement for non-linear one-step methods.

  abstract  = {A new unified theory underlying the theoretical design of linear computational algorithms in the context of time dependent first-order systems is presented. Providing for the first time new perspectives and fresh ideas, and unlike various formulations existing in the literature, the present unified theory involves the following considerations: (i) it leads to new avenues for designing new computational algorithms to foster the notion of algorithms by design and recovering existing algorithms in the literature, (ii) describes a theory for the evolution of time operators via a unified mathematical framework, and (iii) places into context and explains/contrasts future new developments including existing designs and the various relationships among the different classes of algorithms in the literature such as linear multi-step methods, sub-stepping methods, Runge-Kutta type methods, higher-order time accurate methods, etc. Subsequently, it provides design criteria and guidelines for contrasting and evaluating time dependent computational algorithms. The linear computational algorithms in the context of first-order systems are classified as distinctly pertaining to Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3 classifications of time discretized operators. Such a distinct classification, provides for the first time, new avenues for designing new computational algorithms not existing in the literature and recovering existing algorithms of arbitrary order of time accuracy including an overall assessment of their stability and other algorithmic attributes. Consequently, it enables the evaluation and provides the relationships of computational algorithms for time dependent problems via a standardized measure based on computational effort and memory usage in terms of the resulting number of equation systems and the corresponding number of system solves. A generalized stability and accuracy limitation barrier theorem underlies the generic designs of computational algorithms with arbitrary order of accuracy and establishes guidelines which cannot be circumvented. In summary, unlike the traditional approaches and classical school of thought customarily employed in the theoretical development of computational algorithms, the unified theory underlying time dependent first-order systems serves as a viable avenue to foster the notion of algorithms by design. &copy; 2004 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract  = {While in Part I (see [1]) and Part II (see [2]) of this three-part exposition we focused attention on non-dissipative symplectic-momentum conserving designs of time operators for applicability to nonlinear dynamics, here in Part III of this exposition we demonstrate how to further advance the theoretical developments and introduce controllable numerical dissipation via a novel time weighted residual approach we have previously described. The unique aspects of the algorithmic designs are such that when the numerical dissipative features are turned off, the resulting time operators readily recover the original designs of algorithms that are inherently symplectic-momentum conserving (we defer to those that are energy-momentum conserving elsewhere [3, 4]). The focus of the current work is on the theoretical developments of the new formulation termed the displacement based normalized time weighted residual approach for nonlinear dynamics applications. In particular, we provide extensions of the wellknown Generalized Single Solve Single Step (GSSSS) framework, which comprises two distinct classifications, namely constrained U and V algorithmic architectures, and was originally developed for solving linear dynamic problems. Starting with the generalization of the classical time weighted residual approach, the GSSSS framework that was previously developed encompasses the general class of LMS methods represented by the single field form of the second order ordinary differential equations in time involving a single solve, and also covers most of the developments to date in the literature, including providing new avenues towards optimal designs of algorithms. However, the classical time weighted residual approach fails to adequately provide proper extensions to nonlinear dynamics applications. Consequently, the basic premise and argument that is herein advanced is that controllable numerical dissipative time operators designed for linear dynamic problems are very valuable, and are indeed the basis and can be readily employed as the basic parent algorithms, such that when implemented appropriately via the present new time weighted residual representation, they are now readily suitable for extensions to nonlinear dynamics applications. To demonstrate the basic concepts, we consider applications to the Saint Venant Kirchhoff material model simply for illustration, although the method can be readily extended to general material models. The numerical examples presented show that in contrast to the classical time weighted residual approach, which fails to recover the original designs of symplectic-momentum conservation when numerical dissipation is turned off, this new approach readily accomplishes this feature naturally and without enforcing any added constraints, and is the more appropriate way to design a particular class of controllable numerical dissipative schemes. It also leads to algorithm designs that yield fewer numerical oscillations in the energy and angular momentum in contrast to the classical approach, thus additionally confirming the improved effectiveness of the proposed approach. Further, we also show that amongst all the controllable numerical dissipative schemes considered in the sense of and under the framework of LMS methods in the single field form and involving a single solve and second-order time accuracy, the U0- V0optimal is the preferred choice of this particular class of symplectic-momentum conserving based controllable numerical dissipative schemes since: (i) it yields least amount of energy dissipation; and (ii) it is ideal for any given set of initial conditions in the sense that it possesses the highly desirable attributes involving zero order displacement and velocity overshooting behavior. Simple numerical examples are provided that illustrate the fundamental ideas for applications to nonlinear dynamics problems.},

Discontinuous approximations for displacement and stress fields are employed as independent unknowns. Through the properties associated with the inter-element discontinuities the present class of DG methods provide an additional mechanism to alleviate locking in shells. These properties are introduced by means of a suitable definition of numerical fluxes at the element interfaces. Degenerated bilinear quadrilateral element is used as an example, however, the formulation presented here is quite general and easily extendible to elements of other type and order. To demonstrate the effects of the DG approach to shell problems two different formulations of the elements themselves are considered, one with equal order approximations for displacement and stresses and the other with modified stresses (used in continuous finite element approach to eliminate locking). These two element formulations are then used within the DG framework. The results indicate that the DG approach can lead to significant improvements if the inter-element interface properties are selected properly, and several numerical examples are presented to support this feature. However, a rational method of selecting these interface attributes and the associated error estimates are still under investigation. &copy; 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract  = {A novel approach termed as the hybrid displacement-strain based normalized time weighted residual approach is presented in this exposition to accurately solve nonlinear structural dynamic problems. The current work concentrates on the design of a family of conserving time operators which preserve energy, linear and angular momentum conservation properties via this new innovative approach to solve nonlinear dynamic problems. The focus of this work is on Generalized Single Step Single Solve (GSSSS) computational algorithms which encompass the entire framework of those termed as linear multi-step (LMS) methods with unconditional stability and second-order accuracy which are most commonly used for such applications. In general, there exist three roots for LMS based methods, namely, the two principal roots &rho;<inf>1&infin;</inf>, &rho;<inf>2&infin;</inf>, and the spurious root &rho;<inf>3&infin;</inf>. The LMS framework is comprised of two distinct algorithmic structures termed as constrained U and V algorithms. Specifically, it is shown that in the sense of LMS methods, the implementation of V0 algorithms (zero oder velocity overshoot behavior) via the hybrid displacement-strain based normalized weighted residual approach (no external constraints on energy are imposed) with ({&rho;<inf>1&infin;</inf>, &rho;<inf>2&infin;</inf>, &rho;<inf>3&infin;</inf>} = {1.00,1.00, any &rho;<inf>3&infin;</inf> &isin; [0.00,1.00]} readily conserve energy, linear momentum and angular momentum. Although the displacement and velocity are independent of &rho;<inf>3&infin;</inf>, it is shown and proved that different choices of &rho;<inf>3&infin;</inf> gives different values of acceleration at every time step, thus yielding a different algorithm within the family. Nevertheless, in the sense of LMS methods, the entire family results in energy and momentum conserving algorithms regardless of the selection of &rho;<inf>3&infin;</inf> since only displacement and velocity participate in the algorithm as clearly presented in this paper. Numerious numerical illustration are presented to demonstrate the fundamental principles. Copyright &copy; 2008 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract  = {In computational mechanics to date, even after five decades of research dealing with integration of the linear and nonlinear dynamic equations of motion, there exists for the general cases of algorithm designs still a clear lack of a fundamental understanding regarding evaluation of these equations of motion, and how, why, and what precise time levels the integrations need to take place. This has placed major limitations on commercial code developers, and a lack of confidence in general, thereby restricting the implementation of LMS methods to only a select few that happen to be correct, but without any rigorous proofs or underlying reasons explaining the ramifications. This is extremely critical for the general cases of integration of the equations of motion, in particular for the class of Linear Multi-Step (LMS) that are implicit, involve a single solve, and are second-order accurate in time with unconditional stability (this pertains to linear dynamic situations only), since these serve as the backbone and drivers for most finite element commercial and research software. In this regard, the present Part I of the three-part exposition puts the matter to rest and provides closure, while in Part II (see Ref [1]) and Part III (see Ref [2]) we describe extensions to nonlinear dynamics applications of the basic general framework for the classes of nondissipative and controllable numerical dissipative methods, respectively. Within the confines of these LMS methods, particular attention is paid to designing algorithms that are symplectic-momentum preserving, and with enhancements to include controllable dissipative features and optimal algorithm designs. Simply for illustration of the basic ideas, readily understandable numerical examples are presented that validate the overall concepts and developments.},

The focus here is restricted to all possible algorithmic designs within the class of linear multi-step methods that fall under the umbrella of the generalized single solve single step linear dynamic framework originally developed via the classical time-weighted residual approach involving a single solve within each time step as such designs are the most predominant in research and commercial software (Int.

In contrast, a new normalized time-weighted residual approach is proposed that naturally enables such extensions leading to the design of a family of conserving time operators for unconstrained conservative dynamic systems without resorting to enforcing energy constraints as in past practices. Consequently, the algorithmic stability (in the sense of energy stability) via this approach for non-linear dynamic problems is also preserved. For linear dynamic situations, it reverts to the classical paradigm.

  abstract  = {Previously, in Part I (see [1]) of this three-part exposition, we described for the first time for the particular class of LMS methods involving a single system and a single solve within each time step, which are the predominant methods in commercial and research software, how and why the equation of motion needs to be evaluated at precise time levels (which, in general, are not known to date) for ensuring correct algorithm designs. Here in Part II of this exposition, focusing attention on this class of LMS methods, a novel displacement based normalized time weighted residual approach is presented that naturally leads to new designs of a family of numerically non-dissipative (which are of focus here) symplectic-momentum conserving time integration operators without enforcing added or artificial constraints. The objectives are to foster the simulation of nonlinear structural dynamic problems for long-term durations. For illustration, the focus is on the Saint Venant Kirchoff material although the method can be readily extended to general material models (Part III ([2]) further shows extensions of this paper to additionally include controllable numerical dissipation for nonlinear dynamics applications to address issues associated with undesirable participation of the unresolved high frequency modes induced due to spatial discretization). The theoretical developments are described for nonlinear dynamics applications via extensions of the well-known Generalized Single Step Single Solve (GSSSS) linear dynamic framework, which encompasses the class of LMS methods in the single field form. In principle, this framework comprises two distinct classifications, namely, constrained U and V algorithmic architectures (characterized by the overshoot behavior) and was originally developed for designing linear dynamic algorithms using a generalization of the classical time weighted residual method. However, the problem with the classical approach is that it fails to adequately provide proper extensions to nonlinear dynamics applications as illustrated in this paper. In contrast to the classical approach, and also different from other approaches of designing algorithms, we show in this paper, via the new displacement based normalized time weighted residual approach, how to design symplectic-momentum time integrators that are implicit, and maintain second-order time accuracy for the class of general nonlinear inertial dynamics applications. For linear dynamic framework, the present concepts readily revert to the classical approach. Numerical illustrations are presented that demonstrate the computational and implementation aspects for nonlinear structural dynamics applications.},

  abstract  = {The focus in Part 1 of this exposition is strictly restricted to holonomic-sceleronomic systems, and the applications of interest are elastodynamics, which are routinely encountered in a wide class of structural dynamics problems in engineering. Restricting attention to these considerations, new and different perspectives and equivalences are described which deal with finite element space discretization aspects employing three distinctly different frameworks with scalar formalism. It encompasses the Lagrangian mechanics, the Hamiltonian mechanics, and as an alternative, the framework with a built-in measurable quantity based on the Total Energy. Historically, traditional practices routinely employ the weighted residual method or equivalently the principle of virtual work in dynamics for developing finite element formulations. In contrast, the present developments stem from Hamilton's law of varying action (HLVA) as a starting point and involve distinctly different scalar descriptive functions (the Lagrangian [L(q,q): TQ &rarr &Rdbl;], the Hamiltonian [H(p,q): T*Q &rarr &Rdbl;], or the Total Energy [E(q,q):TQ &rarr &Rdbl;]). These developments naturally embody the weak form in space and the statement of the weighted residual in time. Complicated structural dynamical systems such as a rotating bar and the Timoshenko beam are particularly shown here simply for illustration. In Part 2, we describe the satisfaction of conservation properties of the fully discretized equations of motion in space and time with particular attention to the Total Energy framework (in contrast to the Lagrangian and the Hamiltonian), primarily because it is very natural and is computationally attractive and meaningful to conducting the time discretization [1] process. Instead of starting from the continuous form of representations, the particular focus is upon directly employing the discrete formulations for enabling algorithmic designs for the class of LMS methods for linear dynamic problems for illustration purposes. This is a necessary first step in the design of algorithms for integrating the equations of motion, and they serve as the parent algorithms for subsequent extensions to nonlinear dynamic problems.

  abstract  = {For the modeling and simulation of computational dynamics applications with particular reference to holonomic-sceleronomic systems towards which this paper is restricted, it is important to ensure that the space and time numerical discretizations enable proper designs such that the fully discretized system also inherits the same physical attributes (such as energy, linear, and angular momentum conservation properties) as in the continuous case for conservative dynamic systems. Of the various computational frameworks (Newtonian, Lagrangian, Hamiltonian, and Total Energy) that we presented in Part 1, here in Part 2 of the exposition we particularly describe and advocate the so-called Total Energy computational framework for elastodynamics applications. This is because it is a self-contained framework in a natural setting which is computationally attractive. Consequently, it naturally enables the design of structure preserving time integration algorithms, and also inherits the advantages of readily ensuring proof of satisfaction of the conservation laws for the space discretized system. In contrast to Part 1, here in Part 2 of the paper we altogether discard the developments starting from the continuous representations to derive the semi-discretized equations. Instead, we describe yet another route directly starting from the supposition of energy conservation for the space discretized system. In particular, via the Total Energy framework, simply for illustration we describe the design of computational algorithms that are energy-momentum conserving within the scope of the particular class of LMS methods involving a single system of equations with a single solve within a single step representation, since these are the most popular in commercial codes. We demonstrate conserving algorithms by design for linear dynamic systems, which is a necessary first step and basis that is required for consequent extensions of the parent linear dynamics algorithms to general nonlinear dynamic applications, which we hope to disseminate in the near future.

After space discretization using methods such as finite differences, finite volumes, finite elements, and the like, the consequent proper integration of the time continuous ordinary differential equations is extremely important. In particular, the physical quantities of interest may need to be mostly preserved and/or the equations should be optimally integrated so that there is minimal numerical dissipation, dispersion, algorithm overshoot, capture shocks without too much dissipation, solve stiff problems and enable the completion of the analysis, and so on. To-date, practical methods in most commercial and research software include the trapezoidal family (Euler forward/backward, Galerkin, and Crank Nicholson) for first order systems and the other counterpart trapezoidal family (Newmark family and variants with controllable numerical dissipation) for second order systems. For the respective first/second order systems, they are totally separate families of algorithms and are derived from altogether totally different numerical approximation techniques. Focusing on the class of the linear multistep (LMS) methods, algorithms by design was first utilized to develop GS4-2 framework for time integration of second order systems. We have also recently developed the GS4-1 framework for integrating first order systems. In contrast to all past efforts over the past 50 years or so, we present the formalism of a generalized unified framework, termed GS4 (generalized single step single solve), that unifies GS4-1 (first-order systems) and GS4-2 (second-order systems) frameworks for simultaneous use in both first and second order systems with optimal algorithms, numerical and order preserving attributes (in particular, second-order time accuracy) as well. The principal contribution emanating from such an integrated framework is the practicality and convenience of using the same computational framework and implementation when solving first and/or second order systems without having to resort to the individual framework. All that is needed is a single novel GS4-2 framework for either second- and/or first-order systems, and we show how to switch from one to the other for illustrative applications to thermo-mechanical problems influenced by first/second order systems, respectively. &copy; 2014 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.},

The implicit Generalized- algorithm was implemented in a predictor-one corrector form giving rise to the implicit IPC- method, able to avoid expensive iterative corrections in view of high-speed applications. Moreover, the scheme embodies a secant stiffness formula that can closely approximate the actual stiffness of a structure. Also an explicit algorithm endowed with user-controlled dissipation properties, the EPC- b method, was implemented. The resulting schemes were tested experimentally both on a two- and on a six-degrees-of-freedom system, using substructuring. The tests indicated that the numerical strategies enhance the fidelity of the pseudo-dynamic test results even in an environment characterized by considerable experimental errors. Moreover, the schemes were tested numerically on severe non-linear substructured multiple-degrees-of-freedom systems reproduced with the Bouc-Wen model, showing the reliability of the seismic tests under these conditions.

In order to evaluate errors, analytical solutions of frequency response functions (FRFs) are determined by using the Harmonic Balance method in single- and two-degrees-of-freedom viscously damped systems, where the non-linearity is introduced through hardening Duffing oscillators. Successively, the Generalized-α method is implemented in conjunction with the Harmonic Balance method to trace numerical solutions of FRFs. It is shown that the effective resulting algorithm, the Algorithmic Harmonic Balance- ρ  ∞  method, can define non-linear FRFs and allows the errors exhibited by the integration scheme near resonance in terms of frequency location and amplitude of the resonant peak to be quantified. The accuracy estimates demonstrate the robustness of the Generalized-α method also in the forced case and confirm its capability to reproduce amplitudes at resonance in the low frequency range and damp out them in the high frequency range.},

  abstract = {abstract Most finite element packages use the Newmark algorithm for time integration of structural dynamics. Various algorithms have been proposed to better optimize the high frequency dissipation of this algorithm. Hulbert and Chung proposed both implicit and explicit forms of the generalized alpha method. The algorithms optimize high frequency dissipation effectively, and despite recent work on algorithms that possess momentum conserving/energy dissipative properties in a non-linear context, the generalized alpha method remains an efficient way to solve many problems, especially with adaptive timestep control. However, the implicit and explicit algorithms use incompatible parameter sets and cannot be used together in a spatial partition, whereas this can be done for the Newmark algorithm, as Hughes and Liu demonstrated, and for the HHT-algorithm developed from it. The present paper shows that the explicit generalized alpha method can be rewritten so that it becomes compatible with the implicit form. All four algorithmic parameters can be matched between the explicit and implicit forms. An element interface between implicit and explicit partitions can then be used, analogous to that devised by Hughes and Liu to extend the Newmark method. The stability of the explicit/implicit algorithm is examined in a linear context and found to exceed that of the explicit partition. The element partition is significantly less dissipative of intermediate frequencies than one using the HHT-method. The explicit algorithm can also be rewritten so that the discrete equation of motion evaluates forces from displacements and velocities found at the predicted mid-point of a cycle.

  abstract = {Via new perspectives, for the time dimension, the present exposition overviews new and recent advances describing a standardized formal theory towards the evolution, classification, characterization and generic design of time discretized operators for transient/dynamic applications. Of fundamental importance in the present exposition are the developments encompassing the evolution of time discretized operators leading to the theoretical design of computational algorithms and their subsequent classification and characterization. And, the overall developments are new and significantly different from the way traditional modal type and a wide variety of step-by-step time marching approaches which we are mostly familiar with have been developed and described in the research literature and in standard text books over the years. The theoretical ideas and basis towards the evolution of a generalized methodology and formulations emanate under the umbrella and framework and are explained via a generalized time weighted philosophy encompassing the semi-discretized equations pertinent to transient/dynamic systems. It is herein hypothesized that integral operators and the associated representations and a wide variety of the so-called integration operators pertain to and emanate from the same family, with the burden which is being carried by a virtual field or weighted time field specifically introduced for the time discretization is strictly enacted in a mathematically consistent manner so as to first permit obtaining the adjoint operator of the original semi-discretized equation system. Subsequently, the selection or burden carried by the virtual or weighted time fields originally introduced to facilitate the time discretization process determines the formal development and outcome of “exact integral operators”, “approximate integral operators”, including providing avenues leading to the design of new computational algorithms which have not been exploited and/or explored to-date and the recovery of most of the existing algorithms, and also bridging the relationships systematically leading to the evolution of a wide variety of “integration operators”. Thus, the overall developments not only serve as a prelude towards the formal developments for “exact integral operators”, but also demonstrate that the resulting “approximate integral operators” and a wide variety of “new and existing integration operators and known methods” are simply subsets of the generalizations of a standardized W p -Family, and emanate from the principles presented herein. The developments first leading to integral operators in time, and the resulting consequences then systematically leading to not only providing new avenues but additionally also explaining a wide variety of generalized integration operators in time of which single-step time integration operators and various widely recognized algorithms which we are familiar are simply subsets, the associated multi-step time integration operators, and a class of finite element in time integration operators, and their relationships are particularly addressed. The theoretical design developments encompass and explain a variety of time discretized operators, the recovery of various original methods of algorithmic development, and the development of new computational algorithms which have not been exploited and/or explored to-date, and furthermore, permit time discretized operators to be uniquely classified and characterized by algorithmic markers. The resulting and so-called discrete numerically assigned [DNA] algorithmic markers not only serve as a prelude towards providing a standardized formal theory of development of time discretized operators and forum for selecting and identifying time discretized operators, but also permit lucid communication when referring to various time discretized operators. That which constitutes characterization of time discretized operators are the so-called DNA algorithmic markers which essentially comprise of both: (i) the weighted time fields introduced for enacting the time discretization process, and (ii) the corresponding conditions (if any) these weighted time fields impose (dictate) upon the approximations for the dependent field variables and updates in the theoretical development of time discretized operators. As such, recent advances encompassing the theoretical design and development of computational algorithms for transient/dynamic analysis of time dependent phenomenon encountered in engineering, mathematical and physical sciences are overviewed.},

Such systems can be efficiently treated by a class of implicit-explicit (IMEX) diagonally implicit multistage integration methods (DIMSIMs), where the stiff part is integrated by implicit formula, and the non-stiff part is integrated by an explicit formula. We analyze stability of these methods when the implicit and explicit parts interact with each other. We look for methods with large absolute stability region, assuming that the implicit part of the method is A ( α ) -, A-, or L-stable. Finally, we furnish examples of \{IMEX\} \{DIMSIMs\} of order p = 5 and p = 6 and stage order q = p , with good stability properties. Numerical examples illustrate that the \{IMEX\} schemes constructed in this paper do not suffer from order reduction phenomenon for some range of stepsizes. },

A further study of this technique is conducted herein. This include the theoretical evaluation and comparison of the capability to capture the rapid changes of dynamic loading if using the constant average acceleration method and its integral form and the exploration of the superiority of the time integration to reduce the linearization error. In addition, its advantage in the solution of the impact problems or the wave propagation problems is also numerically demonstrated.

Analytical results show that the direct implementation of the subfamily of HHT-伪 method is inappropriate for the pseudodynamic testing although it possesses desired numerical dissipation. However, it is found that the error propagation of high frequency responses can be effectively suppressed by numerical dissipation for the improved implementation of this subfamily of integration methods. Furthermore, the error amplification factor for the improved implementation highly depends on the number of remaining time steps to be performed and the spectral radius of the amplification matrix. In fact, a small spectral radius and/or a large number of remaining time steps will lead to a small error amplification factor. This means an error introduced in an early time step will contribute less to the cumulative error at the end of the test as compared to an error introduced in a later time step.},

  abstract  = {For many systems of differential equations modeling problems in science and engineering, there are often natural splittings of the right hand side into two parts, one of which is non-stiff or mildly stiff, and the other part is stiff. Such systems can be efficiently treated by a class of implicit&ndash;explicit (IMEX) diagonally implicit multistage integration methods (DIMSIMs), where the stiff part is integrated by implicit formula, and the non-stiff part is integrated by an explicit formula. We analyze stability of these methods when the implicit and explicit parts interact with each other. We look for methods with large absolute stability region, assuming that the implicit part of the method is A(&alpha;)-, A-, or L-stable. Finally, we furnish examples of IMEX DIMSIMs of order p=5 and p=6 and stage order q=p, with good stability properties. Numerical examples illustrate that the IMEX schemes constructed in this paper do not suffer from order reduction phenomenon for some range of stepsizes. &copy; 2017 IMACS},

  abstract = {The Wilson-θ method has been proven to have unconditional stability as a numerical direct time integration method in structural dynamics when θ ≥ 1.37 is adopted. Notwithstanding this great advantage of the method, it has also been proven that the method suffers from two shortcomings: high amount of uncontrollable amplitude decay and period elongation. In other words, the unconditional stability allows time step to be stretched, but as the time step grows longer, amplitude decay and period elongation errors grow higher, resulting in a low level of accuracy. The improved version of the Wilson-θ method negates the disadvantages of the classic method by raising the order of acceleration to vary in quadratic scheme over time step domain and by introducing an accelerator coefficient to the acceleration formula in order to control the amount of amplitude decay and lessen the period elongation error. The stability and accuracy of the proposed method has been analyzed, and the results show that unconditional stability is obtained if θ ≥ 1.38 is adopted. A formula is derived for the accelerator coefficient to make it applicable to various types of structural dynamic problems. Numerical examples are presented to provide a practical assessment of the method, along with the classic Wilson-θ and other methods of similar class.},

The method is derived from the implicit high-order accurate method based on the time-continuous Galerkin method proposed earlier in our papers. The basic unknowns for the method are displacements and velocities; accelerations are not calculated. The explicit method uses a predictor–multicorrector technique with one or two passes in order to reach the fourth order of accuracy and has controllable numerical dissipation for the suppression of spurious high-frequency oscillations. In contrast to recently suggested explicit high-order accurate methods based on the time-discontinuous Galerkin method, the new method is more accurate (has a higher order of accuracy) and has better algorithmic properties (e.g., a higher-stability limit) at the same computational efforts. Presented numerical examples show the performance of the new method. The method appears to be competitive for medium- and long-term analysis when accuracy of numerical solutions arises an issue due to error accumulation.},

Thermoelastic wave bands of the in-planex鈥搚mode are calculated for lead/silicone rubber, aluminium/silicone rubber, and aurum/silicone rubber phononic crystals. The new findings in the numerical results indicate that the thermoelastic wave bands are composed of the pure elastic wave bands and the thermal wave bands, and that the thermal wave bands can serve as the low boundary of the first band gap when the filling ratio is low. In addition, for the lead/silicone rubber phononic crystals the effects of lattice type (square, rectangle, regular triangle, and hexagon) and inclusion shape (circle, oval, and square) on the normalized thermoelastic bandwidth and the upper/lower gap boundaries are analysed and discussed.

  abstract = {航天工程实际问题中包含大量结构和机构系统,如卫星包含天线和帆板等柔性结构,天线和帆板展开过程又是机构运动。研究结构的动力学行为,通常是对结构动力学方程进行研究;研究机构的运动,通常利用多体系统动力学的建模理论,建立多体系统动力学方程。空间离散的结构动力学方程为常做分方程的初值问题,多体系统动力学方程为做分一代数方程的初值问题。本文的主要目的是试图研究这两类方程的数值求解。 采用Runge-Kutta方法求解结构动力学方程。针对增量形式的结构动力学方程,推导了Runge-Kutta方法的迭代形式,研究了降低计算量的两种办法,发现了一些传统格式与Runge-Kutta方法之间的关系。基于单自由度自由振动方程,推导了Runge-Kutta方法求解结构动力学方程的逼近算子,直用逼近算子的谱半径可以分析Runge-Kutta方法求解二阶常做分方程的稳定性。通过谱半径图分析出各种格式的数值阻尼的强弱,发现高精度的L-稳定格式具有理想的数值阻尼,在精确求解低频振动的同时很好的抑制高频震荡。通过算例研究,发现较小的物理阻尼在精确解上能快速的耗散高频震荡,对数值计算却影响很小。从而得出结论:在数值计算中通过增加物理阻尼抑制高频震荡是不可行,而采用有数值阻尼的算法才是可行的。 直用适合求解高指标做分-代数方程的求解器,求解高指标形式的多体系统动力学方程。发现采用高指标形式的多体系统动力学方程,使用隐式形式做分方程需要引入新的求解变量少,而且能保持原系统矩阵的稀疏特性。但是存在两个缺点:(1)加速度变量和拉格朗日乘子的求解精度低于位移变量、速度变量的求解精度;(2)对协调一致的初始条件很依赖。针对这两个缺点,提出了对加速度变量和拉格朗日乘子修正的办法。采用修正能提高加速度变量和拉格朗日乘子的求解精度,提高整个计算过程中的收敛性。数值算例表明,采用修正能降低求解的计算量,特别对于容许误差很小的情况,计算量降低更显著。 基于做分方程精确解的Taylor展式,提出了一种新的构造块格式方法;并采用指数函数的Pade逼近作为块格式的稳定性函数,构造出L-稳定的块格式。实际上,块格式也是一类Runge-Kutta方法,从而通过Runge-Kutta方法的精度条件,分析了L-稳定块格式的精度。针对隐式形式做分方程,推导了块格式的并行迭代和局部误差估计方法,采用变步长实现了6阶精度L-稳定格式,编制了求解器PBIDE(Prallell Blocksolver for Implicit Differential Equations)。 针对Runge-Kutta方法在求解做分一代数方程中出现精度降低的情况,提出了多步块格式。分析了多步块格式稳定性和精度条件,证明其为刚性精确的,且级精度与格式精度相同。数值算例表明在求解指标-2的做分-代数方程不会出现精度降低现象。构造出了2级3阶精度的多步块格式,此格式的稳定性函数为指数函数的4阶精度广义Pade逼近,且是L-稳定的;构造出了3级4阶精度的多步块格式,此格式的稳定性函数与Runge-Kutta的稳定性函数一样,为指数函数的有理分式逼近,也是L-稳定格式。推导了多步块格式的Nordsieck表达。基于2级3阶精度的多步块格式,对隐式形式做分方程,采用变步长进行了实现,编制了求解器MBIDE(Multistep Block solverfor Implicit Differential Equations)。 对求解器PBIDE和MBIDE进行测试,与现在使用广泛的求解器进行比较,比较了它们的运行精度和计算量。选用结构动力学的算例、多体系统动力学的算例和几个其它类型的算例对本文的两个求解器进行了测试,测试的结果表明这两个求解器是效率很高的。},

  abstract = {An explicit integration method with unconditional stability was proposed and presented in this paper. Numerical characteristics of this explicit method for linear elastic sys-tems are almost the same as those of the constant average acceleration method while for a nonlinear system it is more efficient in computing than for the constant average acceleration method. This explicit method integrates the most promising advantages possessed by the explicit and implicit methods. No limitation on the time step in satisfying the stability limit, which is the most important property for an implicit method, is theoretically proved for this explicit method. Furthermore, the avoidance of solving any implicit system or using any iterative procedure, which usually brings considerable simplification in practical applications for explicit methods, leads to the very low cost of one explicit step. Thus, the computational effort can be significantly reduced when compared to implicit methods in each time step. Consequently, this explicit method can be used to solve dynamic problems efficiently due to the unconditional stability and the very low cost of explicit steps. Rough guidelines with regards to the selection of a time step in achieving accurate solutions for the constant average acceleration method are also appropriate for the proposed explicit method.},

As alternative to implicit schemes, explicit Runge–Kutta–Nyström methods are analysed, with focus on low order and maximized stability domain since spurious high frequency oscillations need not be resolved. It turns out that it is possible to construct methods with a stability domain that stretches up to hω=2s on the imaginary axis where h is the stepsize, ω the largest frequency in the system, and s the stage number. Simulation examples generated by FEMLAB show that the methods are competitive.},

Thus, there is a need for low order methods that allow relatively large steps and that are computationally not expensive.

The total time of dynamic loading is divided into several time steps. For each two time steps, in modeling the acceleration over time domain, a second order polynomial with three unknown parameters is assumed. Validity and effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through two examples where the results of this method are compared with those numerical methods. In this method, over two steps, six unknown responses (three responses for each time step) consisting of two displacements, two velocities and two accelerations are computed. This property reduces the computational cost of the proposed method as compared to Central difference, Houbolt, Newmark (linear and average), Wilsonetc. Furthermore, accuracy of the results obtained from the proposed method is better than other methods for single and multi-degree of freedom systems. Hence, as advantages of the proposed method, this method has appropriate convergence, accuracy and low computational time. Therefore, the novelty of this work is that for very small values of, this method is more precise and less time consuming rather than other existed methods. This is a useful instrument for the analysis of dynamic systems with very small values of under earthquake loading.},

Using quartic B-spline basis function, this method gained second order of acceleration at each time-step. Thus it benefits from high accuracy compared to the methods in the literature. In this research, in order to applying the iterative process in the procedure, firstly, a series of standard formulas were derived from previous formulation. Then the Newton-Raphson iterative method used to develop new formulation for solving nonlinear dynamic problems. Finally, for the new scheme, a simple step-by-step algorithm is implemented and presented to calculate dynamic response of SDOF systems. The validity and effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated with two examples. The results were compared with those from the famous numerical method. The comparison shows that the proposed method is a fast and simple procedure with trivial computational effort.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a three-point coupled compact integrated radial basis function (CCIRBF) approximation scheme for the discretisation of second-order differential problems in one and two dimensions. The CCIRBF employs integrated radial basis functions (IRBFs) to construct the approximations for its first and second derivatives over a three-point stencil in each direction. Nodal values of the first and second derivatives (i.e. extra information), incorporated into approximations by means of the constants of integration, are simultaneously employed to compute the first and second derivatives. The essence of the CCIRBF scheme is to couple the extra information of the nodal first and second derivative values via their identity equations. Owing to its coupling of the information of the nodal first and second derivatives, the CCIRBF scheme becomes more accurate, stable and efficient than the normal compact integrated radial basis function (CIRBF) schemes proposed by [Thai-Quang, Mai-Duy, Tran, and Tran-Cong (2012)]. The main features of the CCIRBF scheme include: three-point, high-order accuracy, stability, efficiency and inclusion of boundary values. Several analytic problems are considered to verify the present scheme and to compare its accuracy, stability and efficiency with those of the CIRBF, higher-order compact finite difference (HOC) and some other high-order schemes. Numerical results show that highly accurate and stable results are obtained with the proposed scheme. Additionally, the present scheme also takes less time to achieve target accuracy in comparison with the CIRBF and HOC schemes.},

In this paper, the best scales in the multi-scale Fourier expansion interpolation are derived based on the idea of equating the norm of each column of the interpolated matrix, such that the condition number of the preconditioned matrix is minimized.

It is shown that excellent results are achieved by comparing with the differential transformation method and the harmonic balance method.

By adopting the temporal discretization for time finite element approximation, very large time steps can be used by the algorithm.

Using the weighted momentum principle, the problem of discontinuity caused by impulsive loads is resolved after time-integration of the applied load in external momentum. Since no knowledge is required of acceleration at the current time step, the errors caused by estimation of acceleration by previous finite-difference methods are circumvented. Moreover, an iterative procedure is included for each time step, involving the three phases of predictor, corrector, and error-checking. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm in solving nonlinear dynamic problems is demonstrated in the numerical examples.},

In addition, limitations on minimum time step resulting from the approximation that load varies linearly between timesteps are reduced by introducing a polynomial approximation of the load. This means that, in situations where a rapidly varying or transient dynamic load occurs, a larger time-step can still be used while maintaining a good approximation of the forcing function and, hence, the accuracy of the solution. Numerical examples of the HPD-NL scheme compared with Newmark's method and the fourth-order Runge-Kutta (Kutta 4) method are presented.

Existing methods for solving these problems have not been very successful in exploiting parallel computation architectures, mainly because most of the integration methods implemented on parallel machines are only modified versions of forward integration approaches, which are typically poorly suited for parallel computation. This article proposes parallel-structured modified Chebyshev-Picard iteration (MCPI) methods, which iteratively refine estimates of the solutions until the iteration converges. Using Chebyshev polynomials as the orthogonal approximation basis, it is straightforward to distribute the computation of force functions and polynomial coefficients to different processors. A vector-matrix form is introduced that makes the methods computationally efficient. The power of the methods is illustrated through satellite motion propagation problems. Compared with a Runge-Kutta 4-5 forward integration method implemented in MATLAB, the proposed methods generate solutions with improved accuracy as well as several orders of magnitude speedup, even before parallel implementation. Allowing only to integrate position states or perturbation motion achieve further speedup.

  abstract  = {In the past numerical stability theory for initial value problems in ordinary differential equations has propagation mechanisms in stiff problems a question modeled effectively by contractive linear or nonlinear problems. While this has resulted in a coherent and self-contained body of knowledge, it has never been entirely clear to what extent this theory is relevant for problems exhibiting more complicating dynamics. This on-going work is unified and in particular, striking similarities between this new developing stability theory and the classical linear and nonlinear stability theories are emphasized. The classical theories of A, B and algebraic stability for Runge-Kutta methods are briefly reviewed: the dynamics of solutions within the classes of equations to which these theories apply-linear decay and contractive problems - are studied. Four other categories of equations-gradient, dissipative, conservative and Hamiltonian systems - are considered. Relationships and differences between the possible dynamics in each category, which range from multiple competing equilibria to chaotic solutions, are highlighted. Runge-Kutta schemes that preserves the dynamical structures of the underlying problem are sought and indications of a strong relationship between the developing stability theory for these new categories and the classical existing stability theory for the older problems are given. Algebraic stability in particular, is seen to play a central role. It should be emphasized that in all cases the class of methods for which a coherent and complete numerical stability theory exists given a structural assumption on the initial value problem, is often considerably smaller than the class of method found to be effective in practice. Nonetheless it is arguable that it is valuable to develop such stability theories to provide a firm theoretical framework in which to interpret existing methods and to formulate goals in the construction of new methods. Furthermore, there are indications that the theory of algebraic stability may sometimes be useful in the analysis of error control codes which are not stable in a fixed step implementation this work is described.},

These alternative simulation procedures rely on an assumption of local Gaussianity during each time step. This assumption is tantamount to various linearizations of the equations of motion. All of the proposed procedures yield the exact results as the time step goes to zero. The proposed procedures are based on analytical convolutions of the excitation process, hereby, reducing the generation of stochastic processes and numerical integration to the generation of random vectors only. Such a treatment offers higher rates of convergence, faster speed and higher accuracy. These procedures are compared to the direct Monte Carlo simulation procedure, which uses a fourth order Runge-Kutta scheme with the white noise process approximated by a broad band Ruiz-Penzien broken line process. The comparisons show that the so-called Ermark-Allen algorithm developed for simulation applications in molecular dynamics is the most favourable procedure for MDOF structural systems.},

  abstract  = {Wind and gravity both impact trees in storms, but wind loads greatly exceed gravity loads in most situations. Complex behavior of trees in windstorms is gradually turning into a controversial concern among ecological engineers. To better understand the effects of nonlinear behavior of trees, the dynamic forces on tree structures during periods of high winds have been examined as a mass-spring system. In fact, the simulated dynamic forces created by strong winds are studied in order to determine the responses of the trees to such dynamic loads. Many of such nonlinear differential equations are complicated to solve. Therefore, this paper focuses on an accurate and simple solution, Differential Transformation Method (DTM), to solve the derived equation. In this regard, the concept of differential transformation is briefly introduced. The approximate solution to this equation is calculated in the form of a series with easily computable terms. Then, the method has been employed to achieve an acceptable solution to the presented nonlinear differential equation. To verify the accuracy of the proposed method, the obtained results from DTM are compared with those from the numerical solution. The results reveal that this method gives successive approximations of high accuracy solution. &copy; 2012-IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.},

  abstract  = {A symplectic numerical approach to the stability analysis of nonlinear parametric excited systems with multi-degree-of-freedom is developed and the stability of a nonlinear vibration system depends on the dynamic behavior of its perturbation. The nonlinear parameter-varying differential equations for the perturbation motion are expressed in the form of Hamiltonian equations with time-varying Hamiltonian, and are converted further into the classical Hamiltonian equations with extended time-invariant Hamiltonian by augmenting the state variables. The solution to the augmented Hamiltonian equations has the symplectic structure in terms of the symplectic transformation. Then the difference equations of the symplectic Runge-Kutta algorithm with a sufficient condition are constructed, which is proved to preserve the intrinsic symplectic structure of the original solution. In particular, the symplectic Gauss-Runge-Kutta algorithm with stage 2 and order 4 is proposed and applied to the stability analysis of a nonlinear system. Unstable regions based on the nonlinear periodic-parameter perturbation equation are obtained by using the symplectic Gauss-Runge-Kutta algorithm, analytical solution method and non-symplectic conventional Runge-Kutta algorithm to verify the higher accuracy of the proposed algorithm. Unstable regions based on the nonlinear perturbation are given to illustrate the improvement over those based on the linear perturbation.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT  There is growing interest in the potential utility of real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in diagnosing bloodstream infection by detecting pathogen deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in blood samples within a few hours. SeptiFast (Roche Diagnostics GmBH, Mannheim, Germany) is a multipathogen probe-based system targeting ribosomal DNA sequences of bacteria and fungi. It detects and identifies the commonest pathogens causing bloodstream infection. As background to this study, we report a systematic review of Phase III diagnostic accuracy studies of SeptiFast, which reveals uncertainty about its likely clinical utility based on widespread evidence of deficiencies in study design and reporting with a high risk of bias.  Determine the accuracy of SeptiFast real-time PCR for the detection of health-care-associated bloodstream infection, against standard microbiological culture.  Prospective multicentre Phase III clinical diagnostic accuracy study using the standards for the reporting of diagnostic accuracy studies criteria.  Critical care departments within NHS hospitals in the north-west of England.  Adult patients requiring blood culture (BC) when developing new signs of systemic inflammation.  SeptiFast real-time PCR results at species/genus level compared with microbiological culture in association with independent adjudication of infection. Metrics of diagnostic accuracy were derived including sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios and predictive values, with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Latent class analysis was used to explore the diagnostic performance of culture as a reference standard.  Of 1006 new patient episodes of systemic inflammation in 853 patients, 922 (92%) met the inclusion criteria and provided sufficient information for analysis. Index test assay failure occurred on 69 (7%) occasions. Adult patients had been exposed to a median of 8 days (interquartile range 4-16 days) of hospital care, had high levels of organ support activities and recent antibiotic exposure. SeptiFast real-time PCR, when compared with culture-proven bloodstream infection at species/genus level, had better specificity (85.8%, 95% CI 83.3% to 88.1%) than sensitivity (50%, 95% CI 39.1% to 60.8%). When compared with pooled diagnostic metrics derived from our systematic review, our clinical study revealed lower test accuracy of SeptiFast real-time PCR, mainly as a result of low diagnostic sensitivity. There was a low prevalence of BC-proven pathogens in these patients (9.2%, 95% CI 7.4% to 11.2%) such that the post-test probabilities of both a positive (26.3%, 95% CI 19.8% to 33.7%) and a negative SeptiFast test (5.6%, 95% CI 4.1% to 7.4%) indicate the potential limitations of this technology in the diagnosis of bloodstream infection. However, latent class analysis indicates that BC has a low sensitivity, questioning its relevance as a reference test in this setting. Using this analysis approach, the sensitivity of the SeptiFast test was low but also appeared significantly better than BC. Blood samples identified as positive by either culture or SeptiFast real-time PCR were associated with a high probability (> 95%) of infection, indicating higher diagnostic rule-in utility than was apparent using conventional analyses of diagnostic accuracy.  SeptiFast real-time PCR on blood samples may have rapid rule-in utility for the diagnosis of health-care-associated bloodstream infection but the lack of sensitivity is a significant limiting factor. Innovations aimed at improved diagnostic sensitivity of real-time PCR in this setting are urgently required. Future work recommendations include technology developments to improve the efficiency of pathogen DNA extraction and the capacity to detect a much broader range of pathogens and drug resistance genes and the application of new statistical approaches able to more reliably assess test performance in situation where the reference standard (e.g. blood culture in the setting of high antimicrobial use) is prone to error.

For explicit Runge-Kutta methods estimates of the local truncation error are normally used, and currently the most efficient estimates may be obtained as differences of certain pairs of methods of successive orders. Because of the difficulty of deriving methods of intermediate orders of accuracy, and because such methods are efficient for many problems with moderate tolerance requirements, the methods derived by Fehlberg have become particularly well-known. Unfortunately, for problems that reduce to the evaluation of quadratures, Fehlberg's methods give error estimates which are identically zero, and hence the estimates are unreliable for problems that are at least partially of this type. The methods developed here are designed to overcome this difficulty. The approach yields new methods of arbitrarily high orders of accuracy, and the parameters of four particular pairs of methods of orders 5(6), 6(7), 7(8), 8(9) are included.},

If the stepsize is fixed, this use of previous computations makes it possible to obtain the solution at the next point by evaluating F two or three times for the third or fourth order method, respectively.These methods are consistent with the initial value problem and are shown to be convergent with its unique solution under certain restrictions.

   theoretical developments and representations of time discretized
   operators which theoretically inherit Nth order accuracy for dynamic
   systems is first designed and proposed which encompass both implicit and
   explicit unconditionally stable representations of the time discretized
   operators. Whereas Part 1 primarily focuses on the fundamental
   theoretical developments and rigor of the generalized representations as
   related to stability, accuracy and the like, in Part 2 we specifically
   focus attention towards practical second-order time accurate
   representations including also assessing the algorithmic attributes and
   extensions to nonlinear situations. Also described as particular cases
   are the consequences leading to various other time discretized
   operators. Simple illustrative numerical examples are then presented to
   demonstrate the excellent algorithmic and numerical properties of
   selected implicit and explicit second-order time discretized operators
   which closely mimic the properties of the exact solutions including
   nonlinear dynamic response situations. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract  = {A standardized formal theory of development/evolution, characterization and design of a wide variety of computational algorithms emanating from a generalized time weighted residual philosophy for dynamic analysis is first presented with subsequent emphasis on detailed formulations of a particular class relevant to the so-called time integration approaches which belong to a much broader classification relevant to time discretized operators. Of fundamental importance in the present exposition is the evolution of the theoretical design and the subsequent characterization encompassing a wide variety of time discretized operators, and the proposed developments are new and significantly different from the way traditional modal type and a wide variety of step-by-step time integration approaches with which we are mostly familiar have been developed and described in the research literature and in standard text books over the years. The theoretical ideas and basis towards the evolution of a generalized methodology and formulations emanate under the umbrella and framework and are explained via a generalized time weighted philosophy encompassing single-field and two-field forms of representations of the semi-discretized dynamic equations of motion. Therein, the developments first leading to integral operators in time, and the resulting consequences then systematically leading to and explaining a wide variety of generalized time integration operators of which the family of single-step time integration operators and various widely recognized and new algorithms are subsets, the associated multi-step time integration operators and a class of finite element in time integration operators, and their relationships are particularly addressed. The generalized formulations not only encompass and explain a wide variety of time discretized operators and the recovery of various original methods of algorithmic development, but furthermore, naturally inherit features for providing new avenues which have not been explored and/or exploited to-date and permit time discretized operators to be uniquely characterized by algorithmic markers. The resulting and so-called discrete numerically assigned [DNA] markers not only serve as a prelude towards providing a standardized formal theory of development of time discretized operators and forum for selecting and identifying time discretized operators, but also permit lucid communication when referring to various time discretized operators. That which constitutes characterization of time discretized operators are the so-called DNA algorithmic markers which essentially comprise of both (i) the weighted time fields introduced for enacting the time discretization process, and (ii) the corresponding conditions these weighted time fields impose (dictate) upon the approximations (if any) for the dependent field variables in the theoretical development of time integrators and the associated updates of the time discretized operators. Furthermore, a single analysis code which permits a variety of choices to the analyst is now feasible for performing structural dynamics computations on modern computing platforms.

  abstract  = {
A new method based on quadratic programming theory is proposed to determine the regularization parameter. A function whose variable is the derivative with respect to the regularization parameter is formulated. Based on the property that the value of the function is very dependent on the regularization parameter, the optimal parameters can be determined by using quadratic programming theory. A numerical example is utilized to select the parameters through the method. It is concluded that the new method can effectively overcome the ill-posed problems from an ill-conditioned system matrix, and that it can obtain an approximate solution with higher accuracy, fine stability and effective noise resistance.

   mass systems, which are only valid if mass is gained or lost at null
   velocity with respect to an inertial reference frame for variable mass
   systems, thus the numerical algorithms for time-varying structures based
   on these principles are only suitable for this special case. In this
   paper, Hamilton's law of variable mass system is derived based on
   Meshchersky's fundamental equation, and two classes of novel time finite
   element formulations for linear systems with arbitrary continuous
   time-varying parameters are developed based on the previous law. The
   formulations are verified extensively through numerical examples in
   which the convergence and effectiveness of algorithms are evaluated.
   Numerical examples demonstrate that compared with the algorithms for
   time-varying structures that developed based on traditional principles
   of mechanics, the proposed algorithms provide extended capabilities in
   both time-varying mass problems that mass is gained or lost at any
   velocity (such as rocket problem) and moving-mass problems (such as
   vehicle-bridge interaction problem) besides the time-varying stiffness
   and damping problems, the proposed algorithms have a wider range of
   application. In particular, Hamilton's law of variable mass system
   provides a solid theoretical foundation for further research on the
   algorithm design for time-varying structures. Copyright (C) 2014 John

   is proved through finite difference analysis that these algorithms are

   Generalized-a (G-a) method, is presented for solving structural dynamics
   problems with nonlinear stiffness. The traditional G-a method has
   undesired overshoot properties as for a class of alpha-method. In the
   present work, seven independent parameters are introduced into the
   single-step three-stage algorithmic formulations and the nonlinear
   internal force at every time interval is approximated by means of the
   generalized trapezoidal rule, and then the algorithm is implemented
   based on the finite difference theory. An analysis on the stability,
   accuracy, energy and overshoot properties of the proposed scheme is
   performed in the nonlinear regime. The values or the ranges of values of
   the seven independent parameters are determined in the analysis process.
   The computational results obtained by the new algorithm show that the
   displacement accuracy is of order two, and the acceleration can also be
   improved to a second order accuracy by a suitable choice of parameters.
   Obviously, the present algorithm is zero-stable, and the energy
   conservation or energy decay can be realized in the high-frequency
   range, which can be regarded as stable in an energy sense. The
   algorithmic overshoot can be completely avoided by using the new
   algorithm without any constraints with respect to the damping force and
   initial conditions.}},

  abstract  = {Implicit-explicit (IMEX) time stepping methods can efficiently solve differential equations with both stiff and nonstiff components. IMEX Runge-Kutta methods and IMEX linear multistep methods have been studied in the literature. In this paper we study new implicit-explicit methods of general linear type. We develop an order conditions theory for high stage order partitioned general linear methods (GLMs) that share the same abscissae, and show that no additional coupling order conditions are needed. Consequently, GLMs offer an excellent framework for the construction of multi-method integration algorithms. Next, we propose a family of IMEX schemes based on diagonally-implicit multi-stage integration methods and construct practical schemes of order up to three. Numerical results confirm the theoretical findings. &copy; 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

The one-step block method will solve the second-order ODEs without reducing to first-order equations. The direct solutions of the general second-order ODEs will be calculated at two points simultaneously using variable step size. The method is formulated using the linear multistep method, but the new method possesses the desirable feature of the one-step method. The implementation is based on the predictor and corrector formulas in the P E (C E) m mode. The stability and precision of this method will also be analyzed and deliberated.

  abstract  = {A numerical method is proposed for estimating the blow-up time and the blow-up rate of the solution of ordinary differential equation (ODE), when the solution diverges at a finite time, that is, the blow-up time. The main idea is to transform the ODE into a tractable form by the arc length transformation technique [S. Moriguti, C. Okuno, R. Suekane, M. Iri, K. Takeuchi, Ikiteiru Suugaku-Suuri Kougaku no Hatten (in Japanese), Baifukan, Tokyo, 1979.], and to generate a linearly convergent sequence to the blow-up time. The sequence is then accelerated by the Aitken &Delta;<sup>2</sup> method. The present method is applied to the blow-up problems of partial differential equations (PDEs) by discretising the equations in space and integrating the resulting ODEs by an ODE solver, that is, the method of lines approach. Numerical experiments on the three PDEs, the semi-linear reaction-diffusion equation, the heat equation with a nonlinear boundary condition and the semi-linear reaction-diffusion system, show the validity of the present method. &copy; 2005.},

  abstract  = {The use of the recently discovered DIMSIM (Diagonally IMplicit Multi-Step Integration Method) class of general linear methods for the numerical solution of ordinary differential equations has been investigated with the purpose of developing software based on these methods. DIMSIMs have high stage order and provide a Nordsieck vector at each integration step with essentially no additional computational cost. The implementation advantages of these features were extensively explored. Simplified procedures are developed for deriving parameters used in the calculation of the Nordsieck vector, interpolation, and error estimation. A continuous interpolant based on the Nordsieck vector and requiring no additional function evaluations has been developed that exists for all DIMSIMs. An automatic starting procedure has been developed and successfully tested. Second and fifth order adaptive explicit solvers DIMEX2 and DIMEX5 were developed in FORTRAN 77 and were competitive in testing against established codes on DETEST. A FASAL (First Approximately Same As Last) implementation approach was developed which takes advantage of high stage order to eliminate one internal stage calculation per step. It is shown that FASAL implementations require separate stability analyses. New Richardson and companion method approaches to error estimation are proposed that also use high stage order and require essentially no additional computational cost. Heuristic estimates for stiff problems for both second and fifth order implicit methods were developed based on a Richardson approach. Alternative predictor-corrector DIMSIM implementations were analyzed. Finally, prototype second and fifth order adaptive stiff solvers were developed and tested successfully.

  abstract  = {Two families of Rothe's methods that are based on the discretization of the time variable and keeping the spatial one continuous for the solution of second-order hyperbolic equations with damping and nonlinear source terms are presented. The first family is based on time integration and results in a Volterra integro-differential equation which, upon approximating certain time integrals, can be written as an ordinary differential equation in space. Upon discretizing the spatial derivatives by means of finite difference formula, this family results in nonlinear algebraic equations which contain exponential terms that depend on the time step, and its accuracy is shown to be lower than that of an explicit second-order accurate discretization in both space and time of second-order hyperbolic equations. The second family of methods is based on the discretization of the time derivatives and time linearization, and results in linear ordinary differential equations in space. Upon freezing the coefficients of these equations, one can integrate analytically the resulting linear ordinary differential equations to obtain piecewise exponential solutions which are continuous in space, and three-point finite difference equations which depend exponentially on the time step, spatial grid size, and the diffusion, relaxation, damping and reaction times. The finite difference equations are shown to result in non-diagonally dominant matrices unless the time step is smaller than the characteristic relaxation, diffusion, damping and reaction times. To avoid this problem, two Rothe's techniques that do not account for the Jacobian of the reaction terms in the ordinary differential operator are developed, and it is shown that the Rothe's techniques belonging to the second family are as accurate as the linearly implicit methods presented in Part I provided that the relaxation time is smaller than the critical time and the solution does not oscillate in space. When the relaxation time is greater than the critical one, Rothe's methods have been found to be less accurate than the finite difference techniques of Part I. The Rothe's techniques belonging to the second family are generalized to systems of nonlinear second-order hyperbolic equations and mixed systems of parabolic and second-order hyperbolic partial differential equations. &copy; 2007 Elsevier Inc.

For the former there exists a sector on which the solution is dominated by all independent solutions as the singularity is approached. No such sector exists for implicit solutions. In consequence, the two types of solution have different uniqueness properties. Another difference is that error bounds for the asymptotic expansions of explicit solutions are generally stronger than those for implicit solutions. We also investigate the computation of the solutions by numerical integration of the differential equation. It is shown that it is the exception rather than the rule for the integration process to be stable, particularly so for implicit solutions. To overcome these instabilities we develop boundary-value methods, complete with error analysis. Numerical examples illustrate the computation of both explicit and implicit solutions, and also the associated Stokes multipliers.},

  abstract  = {In the present study, we consider multi-step iterative method to solve systems of nonlinear equations. Since the Jacobian evaluation and its inversion are expensive, in order to achieve a better computational efficiency, we compute Jacobian and its inverse only once in a single cycle of the proposed multi-step iterative method. Actually the involved systems of linear equations are solved by employing the LU-decomposition, rather than inversion. The primitive iterative method (termed base method) has convergence-order (CO) five and then we describe a matrix polynomial of degree two to design a multi-step method. Each inclusion of single step in the base method will increase the convergence-order by three. The general expression for CO is 3s-1, where s is the number of steps of the multi-step iterative method. Computational efficiency is also addressed in comparison with other existing methods. The claimed convergence-rates proofs are established. The new contribution in this article relies essentially in the increment of CO by three for each added step, with a comparable computational cost in comparison with existing multi-steps iterative methods. Numerical assessments are made which justify the theoretical results: in particular, some systems of nonlinear equations associated with the numerical approximation of partial differential equations (PDEs) and ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are built up and solved. &copy; 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract  = {Parameter estimation for nonlinear differential equations is notoriously difficult because of poor or even no convergence of the nonlinear fit algorithm due to the lack of appropriate initial parameter values. This paper presents a method to gather such initial values by a simple estimation procedure. The method first determines the tangent slope and coordinates for a given solution of the ordinary differential equation (ODE) at randomly selected points in time. With these values the ODE is transformed into a system of equations, which is linear for linear appearance of the parameters in the ODE. For numerically generated data of the Lorenz attractor good estimates are obtained even at large noise levels. The method can be generalized to nonlinear parameter dependency. This case is illustrated using numerical data for a biological example. The typical problems of the method as well as their possible mitigation are discussed. Since a rigorous failure criterion of the method is missing, its results must be checked with a nonlinear fit algorithm. Therefore the method may serve as a preprocessing algorithm for nonlinear parameter fit algorithms. It can improve the convergence of the fit by providing initial parameter estimates close to optimal ones. &copy; 2013 The Author. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract  = {Differential equations of the form F (x', x, t) = 0 with Fx' singular arise naturally in many applications and are generally called differential algebraic equations (DAE). There has been an extensive amount of research on numerical solutions of DAEs in recent years. While the classical ODE methods such as backward differentiation and Runga-Kutta methods can be used to numerically solve DAEs, they require the problem to have lower index or special structure. One approach proposed for solving more general, higher index DAEs is called explicit integration (EI). The original DAE is differentiated a number of times based on certain parameters and the new system of equations is solved using nonlinear least squares methods. The result is a computed ODE whose solutions contain the solutions of the DAE. It is called the least squares completion (LSC). This ODE is then numerically integrated by a classical numerical method. The EI method is computationally efficient and can be applied to a wide class of DAEs. However, the dynamics of the additional solutions present in the completion can effect the numerical integration, sometimes causing the numerical solutions to move away from the solution manifold. In this thesis, we analyze the additional dynamics of LSCs for linear DAEs. Starting with linear constant coefficient systems, we first examine the structure of the additional dynamics created by the standard LSC and then introduce two methods to modify the completion process so that the LSC will have additional dynamics with desired stability characteristics. The rate of stabilized convergence can be determined a priori by substituting an appropriate value for a parameter. We then extend the results to linear time variable systems.

  abstract  = {Sophisticated numerical methods must be implemented to solve the large, high dimensional ODE and PDE problems that arise in cardiac electrophysiology. This dissertation examines the nature of these problems and exactly what make them so difficult to solve as well as practical solution strategies that can be successfully applied to the cardiac model and to other problems with similar characteristics. A basic description of the cardiac model is presented along with an overview of some of the currently used solution techniques. The drawbacks of the currently used methods will motivate the advanced schemes developed here. The general framework for solving the reaction-diffusion PDE is operator splitting which gives two subproblems: a system of ODEs and a parabolic PDE. Although others have used this method, the splitting error was unknown and the splitting time step chosen certainly was not optimal. An error analysis will be made for the cardiac model to show the accuracy even with a large splitting step to allow for flexibility in choosing ODE and PDE time steps. In particular, it will allow small adaptive time stepping to be used for the ODE while a much larger time step is used for the PDE. It will be shown that the cardiac ODE suffers from two serious complications: stiffness and steep gradients in the solution. A highly efficient implicit adaptive solver is developed to deal with these issues. The adaptive time step will be based on an error estimate that is efficient for implicit schemes and measured using a novel norm that is weighted in the components that change the most rapidly. Reduced manifold methods are explored as another way to solve the cardiac model and stiff systems of ODEs in general. Stiff ODES define a slow invariant manifold (SIM) in phase space which can be exploited to approximate the solution. A practical reduced manifold method is the intrinsic low dimensional manifold (ILDM) method which approximates the SIM. The full ODE is solved until the solution approaches the manifold; then, an algebraic equation describing the manifold along with a reduced ODE on the manifold are solved. A novel, modified ILDM approach is developed which generalizes the ILDM method to any stiff non-linear system.

  abstract  = {Numerical methods for integrating partial differential equations are used in nearly every scientific field. In this dissertation we study two types of numerical integration methods, transient methods and pseudo-transient methods. Transient methods for partial differential equations look for time-accurate solutions that explain the evolution of the equation (although a steady state solution may evolve). Pseudo-transient methods look for steady-state solutions of partial differential equations while paying attention to the transient behavior to aid in stability. In contrast, root-finding methods, e.g. line-search methods, look only for a steady-state solution often not paying attention at all to the transient behavior of the problem. Pseudo-transient continuation is a method for solving steady state solutions of partial differential equations, and is used when traditional line-search methods fail to converge or converge to non-physical solutions. The method is a hybrid between implicit Euler and Newton's method where variable step-sizes are used to transfer from one method to the other. We demonstrate the performance of pseudo-transient continuation both numerically and theoretically on a variety of problems. We extend the global convergence theory, which currently covers a class of ordinary differential equations, to include a class of semi-explicit index-1 differential-algebraic equations. We also studied CVode, a transient code for solving nonlinear partial differential equations. In this work, we explain how CVode was extended to allow for a two-grid nonlinear solver. The two-grid solver coarsens a given mesh and solves the nonlinear problem on the coarse mesh, which is then moved back to the fine mesh for refining. This approach can be less expensive than computing the full nonlinear solution on the fine mesh. We explore some of the theoretical and computational issues involved in implementing this method for a radiative transfer problem as might be seen in stellar fusion.

  abstract  = {A Legendre pseudospectral method is proposed for solving approximately an inverse problem of determining an unknown control parameter p(t) which is the coefficient of the solution u(x, y, z, t) in a diffusion equation in a three-dimensional region. The diffusion equation is to be solved subject to suitably prescribed initial-boundary conditions. The presence of the unknown coefficient p(t) requires an extra condition. This extra condition considered as the integral overspecification over the spacial domain. For discretizing the problem, after homogenization of the boundary conditions, we apply the Legendre pseudospectral method in a matrix based manner. As a results a system of nonlinear differential algebraic equations is generated. Then by using suitable transformation, the problem will be converted to a homogeneous time varying system of linear ordinary differential equations. Also a pseudospectral method for efficient solving of the resulted system of ordinary differential equations is proposed. The solution of this system gives the approximation to values of u and p. The matrix based structure of the present method makes it easy to implement.

  abstract  = {In this paper, we discuss a meshless method for the computation of a numerical solution of unsteady coupled Burgers'-type equations which are, in the most general case, nonlinear partial differential equations. Our approach is based on the interpolation of the solution by radial basis functions (RBFs) and is independent of the geometry of the domain. The existence and unicity of such of an interpolant will be established by the mean of linear algebra arguments. This spatial discretization transforms the initial problem into a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We give a simple formulation of implicit Runge-Kutta (IRK) schemes that can be used to numerically solve this system of ODEs. The main difficulty in the implementation of an IRK method lies in the fact that it leads to a potentially large linear or nonlinear system that has to be solved at each time step. A matrix-GMRES approach, coupled with a Newton based linearization technique in the nonlinear case, will be used to numerically solve these systems. Some numerical examples will be provided to illustrate the performance of our approach. &copy; 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract  = {Robust and efficient numerical methods are an essential prerequisite for the computer-based dynamical analysis of engineering systems. In vehicle system dynamics, the methods and software tools from multibody system dynamics provide the integration platform for the analysis, simulation and optimisation of the complex dynamical behaviour of vehicles and vehicle components and their interaction with hydraulic components, electronical devices and control structures. Based on the principles of classical mechanics, the modelling of vehicles and their components results in nonlinear systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) or differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) of moderate dimension that describe the dynamical behaviour in the frequency range required and with a level of detail being characteristic of vehicle system dynamics. Most practical problems in this field may be transformed to generic problems of numerical mathematics like systems of nonlinear equations in the (quasi-)static analysis and explicit ODEs or DAEs with a typical semi-explicit structure in the dynamical analysis. This transformation to mathematical standard problems allows to use sophisticated, freely available numerical software that is based on well approved numerical methods like the Newton-Raphson iteration for nonlinear equations or Runge-Kutta and linear multistep methods for ODE/DAE time integration. Substantial speed-ups of these numerical standard methods may be achieved exploiting some specific structure of the mathematical models in vehicle system dynamics. In the present paper, we follow this framework and start with some modelling aspects being relevant from the numerical viewpoint. The focus of the paper is on numerical methods for static and dynamic problems, including software issues and a discussion which method fits best for which class of problems. Adaptive components in state-of-the-art numerical software like stepsize and order control in time integration are introduced and illustrated by a well-known benchmark problem from rail vehicle simulation. Over the last few decades, the complexity of high-end applications in vehicle system dynamics has frequently given a fresh impetus for substantial improvements of numerical methods and for the development of novel methods for new problem classes. In the present paper, we address three of these challenging problems of current interest that are today still beyond the mainstream of numerical mathematics: (i) modelling and simulation of contact problems in multibody dynamics, (ii) real-time capable numerical simulation techniques in vehicle system dynamics and (iii) modelling and time integration of multidisciplinary problems in system dynamics including co-simulation techniques. &copy; 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

  abstract  = {This dissertation is concerned with numerical solutions to steady state 2-dimensional nonlinear elliptical partial differential equations with Dirichlet boundary conditions in a rectangular region. Three numerical schemes discussed in this dissertation are the iterative method, Newton's method, and the shooting method. In general the shooting method is only applied in ordinary differential equations, not in partial differential equations. In order to apply the shooting method and the Newton's method in a nonlinear partial differential equation, the alternating direction procedure is applied. Details of how to apply these three schemes are discussed in this dissertation as well as the implementation and numerical experiments. Numerical results show that the alternating direction shooting method and the alternating direction Newton's method performed better than the commonly used linearized iterative method. Moreover, the greatest advantage of using the alternating direction procedure on the shooting method and Newton's method is that the computation is totally parallel. Therefore, if a parallel computing were to be used, it could achieve greater speedup. However the shooting method suffers stability problems as in ordinary differential equations. One possible way in which instability may be conquered is the consideration of multiple shooting methods which is not the objective of this dissertation.

  abstract  = {A series of new coarse-mesh numerical methods for the solution of the two-dimensional shallow-water equations is developed, first for the beta-plane model and then on the surface of a sphere. As with other methods of this type (so-called "nodal" methods), the partial differential equations are transverse averaged over each computational element or "node," and the ordinary differential equations resulting from this procedure are solved analytically within each element, with the solutions being written in terms of the dependent variables averaged along the element boundaries. The remaining parts of the equations, which are collected in source-like terms, are approximated via low-order expansions to complete the discretization process. The resulting set of nonlinear algebraic equations is solved iteratively using a Newton-Krylov method. Three new methods are developed for the shallow-water model in the beta-plane with a second-order, linear viscosity term. The first method is developed for the steady-state shallow-water model. This method is extended to the time-dependent equations by approximating the temporal derivatives with a simple finite-difference scheme, thereby resulting in a hybrid method combining features from both the nodal integral and finite-difference approaches. Finally, a method is developed for the time-dependent equations by applying the nodal integral approach to both the spatial and temporal terms. Each new method in the beta-plane is applied to several test problems, the analytical solutions of which are available, and the numerical results are compared to these analytical solutions. The third method also is applied to other elementary flow problems for which analytical solutions are not available. The numerical results at several resolutions are compared to demonstrate that the method provides accurate results on coarse meshes. Next, a systematic treatment of the transverse averaging procedure for general orthogonal curvilinear coordinates is developed. This new technique is used to develop a new method for the continuity equation in spherical coordinates which is tested by advecting a test pattern around the surface of a sphere. Finally, a different, new nodal integral method that conserves both mass and absolute vorticity is developed for the inviscid shallow-water equations in spherical coordinates. This method is tested using several selected benchmark problems for this system of equations. The accuracy of the method is discussed and compared to other methods for the shallow-water equations on the sphere.

  abstract  = {In trying to solve nonlinear partial differential equations with time dependence using the Galerkin method, one ends up with solving nonlinear systems of ordinary differential equations, which are not easily solved. In this thesis we introduce a new iterative method based on eigenfunction expansion to deal with the finite non-linear systems sequentially. We apply the new method to integrate the semi-linear parabolic equation ut=12u+fu,x&isin;D with homogeneous Dirichlet or Robin boundary conditions. We prove the convergence of the new iterative method, and use it to find the multiple solutions of the system, which are difficult to obtain using the Galerkin method. We next apply the new method to solve a parabolic system of two semi-linear equations. ut=12u+f u,q qt=12 q+gu,q,x&isin;D with homogeneous boundary conditions Au = 0 and Bv = 0. We prove the convergence of the new method for the case when A = B. If A &ne; B no analytical statements are obtained. However, the proof of convergence is a sufficient, but not a necessary condition, and numerical calculations indicate that the solution obtained by the new method still converges to that obtained by the Galerkin method for the case when A &ne; B. We apply the new method to integrate a system in combustion theory, and we are able to find critical (as defined in Chapter 4) solutions for the system, which are not easily found using the Galerkin method. To see that the new method can be applied to more general systems, we use it to integrate the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. 6tu+41+e 264xu+e6 2xu+12 6xu2=0,x&isin;0,&ell; We prove the convergence of the iterative method and use it to find the first term of the eigenfunction expansion analytically, and from that we notice that the equation has two solutions, one stable and the other unstable.

  abstract  = {This thesis documents three investigations carried out in pursuance of a doctoral degree in applied mathematics at the University of Colorado (Boulder). The first investigation concerns the properties of rotating Rayleigh-Benard convection -- thermal convection in a rotating infinite plane layer between two constant-temperature boundaries. It is noted that in certain parameter regimes convective Taylor columns appear which dominate the dynamics, and a semi-analytical model of these is presented. Investigation of the columns and of various other properties of the flow is ongoing. The second investigation concerns the interactions between planetary-scale and mesoscale dynamics in the oceans. Using multiple-scale asymptotics the possible connections between planetary geostrophic and quasigeostrophic dynamics are investigated, and three different systems of coupled equations are derived. Possible use of these equations in conjunction with the method of superparameterization, and extension of the asymptotic methods to the interactions between mesoscale and submesoscale dynamics is ongoing. The third investigation concerns the linear stability properties of semi-implicit methods for the numerical integration of ordinary differential equations, focusing in particular on the linear stability of IMEX (Implicit-Explicit) methods and exponential integrators applied to systems of ordinary differential equations arising in the numerical solution of spatially discretized nonlinear partial differential equations containing both dispersive and dissipative linear terms. While these investigations may seem unrelated at first glance, some reflection shows that they are in fact closely linked. The investigation of rotating convection makes use of single-space, multiple-time-scale asymptotics to deal with dynamics strongly constrained by rotation. Although the context of thermal convection in an infinite layer seems somewhat removed from large-scale ocean dynamics, the asymptotic methods generalize directly to the second investigation which simply adds large spatial scales -- the transition from convectively unstable to convectively stable dynamics does not change the mathematical framework. The rotating Navier-Stokes equations in the Boussinesq approximation and the equations derived from them asymptotically in the investigation of rotating convection include dispersive and dissipative linear terms that are stiff, i.e. that hinder numerical solution by explicit methods. A variety of methods which purport to alleviate this difficulty have been derived, and have been tested on and applied largely to problems with purely dissipative linear terms. But it was heretofore unfortunately quite difficult to judge and compare how effectively these methods achieve their goal when the stiff linear term is both dissipative and dispersive. The third investigation therefore introduces a visual, analytical method for comparing the linear stability properties of the various methods (the linear stability properties being a proxy for their ability to alleviate stiffness) and supports the results of this analysis by comprehensive numerical experiments.

  abstract  = {Two new methods of numerical integration of Cauchy problems for nonlinear ODEs of the first- and second-order, which have blow-up solutions are described. In such problems, the position of the singular point is not known in advance. The first method is based on obtaining an equivalent system of equations by applying a differential transformation, where the first derivative (given in the original equation) is chosen as a new independent variable, t=y<inf>x</inf><sup>&prime;</sup>. The second method is based on introducing a new auxiliary non-local variable of the form &xi;=&int;<inf>x<inf>0</inf></inf><sup>x</sup>g(x,y,y<inf>x</inf><sup>&prime;</sup>)dx with the subsequent transformation to the Cauchy problem for the corresponding system of coupled ODEs. Both methods lead to problems whose solutions are represented in parametric form and do not have blowing-up singular points; therefore the standard fixed-step numerical methods can be applied. The efficiency of the proposed methods is illustrated with a number of test problems that admit exact solutions. It is shown that the methods, based on special exp-type transformations (which are particular cases of the general non-local transformation), are more efficient than the method based on the hodograph transformation, the method of the arc-length transformation, and the method based on the differential transformation. The method, based on introducing a non-local variable, can be generalized to the n&nbsp;th-order ODEs and systems of coupled ODEs. &copy; 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

As a general introduction the different dynamic model types, the generic modeling cycle and several approaches for dynamic optimization, i.e., optimization problems with dynamic systems as constraints, are briefly mentioned. Then, the estimation problem is posed as a maximum likelihood dynamic optimization problem. Afterwards, we review Multiple Shooting techniques and generalized Gauss-Newton methods for general least-squares and L1-norm optimization problems and discuss the benefits of the recently developed Lifted Newton Method in the context of state and parameter estimation. Finally, we present an illustrative example involving the estimation of the states and parameters of a pendulum using the freely available software environment ACADO Toolkit in which many of the discussed algorithms are implemented. &copy; 2012 Springer London.},

Despite the importance of such models in many branches of science they have not been the focus of systematic statistical analysis until recently. In this work we propose a general approach to estimate the parameters of systems of differential equations measured with noise. Our methodology is based on the maximization of the penalized likelihood where the system of differential equations is used as a penalty. To do so, we use a reproducing kernel Hilbert space approach that allows us to formulate the estimation problem as an unconstrained numeric maximization problem easy to solve. The proposed method is tested with synthetically simulated data and it is used to estimate the unobserved transcription factor cdaR in Streptomyces coelicolor using gene expression data of the genes it regulates. &copy; 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We prove stability of the method by relating it to a diagonally preconditioned system that has a bounded condition number, in a suitable norm. For Dirichlet boundary conditions, this implies stability in the standard 2-norm. An adaptive QR factorization is developed to efficiently solve the resulting linear system and automatically choose the optimal number of Chebyshev coefficients needed to represent the solution.

As a result, a general, consistent index reduction from arbitrarily high values to one is obtained, allowing the use of any suitable ODE integration algorithm, without the need for a specialized DAE solver. The EPM solution is intrinsically endowed with greater accuracy and stability than conventional counterparts, thus balancing the higher complexity of the procedure.

The methods are explicit, unconditionally stable, and of spectral-order accuracy in space and second-order accuracy in time. Moreover, they are time reversible and time transverse invariant when there is no damping term in GZS or VZSM, conserve (or keep the same decay rate of) the wave energy as that in GZS or VZSM without a (or with a linear) damping term, and give exact results for the plane-wave solution. Extensive numerical tests are presented for plane waves and solitary-wave collisions in one-dimensional GZS, and we also give the dynamics of three-dimensional VZSM to demonstrate our new efficient and accurate numerical methods. Furthermore, the methods are applied to study the convergence and quadratic convergence rates of VZSM to GZS and of GZS to the nonlinear Schro&die;dinger (NLS) equation in the "subsonic limit" regime (0 &lt; &Epsilon; &lt; 1), where the parameter &Epsilon; is inversely proportional to the acoustic speed.

This multiscale system models the electrical activity of the heart and it consists of two degenerate parabolic non-linear reaction-diffusion equations, coupled with a stiff system of ordinary differential equations. The numerical discretization of the whole system by finite elements in space and semi-implicit methods in time generates ill-conditioned linear systems that must be solved at each time step. The multilevel algorithm studied employs a hierarchy of nested meshes with overlapping Schwarz preconditioners on each level and is additive within the levels and multiplicative among the levels. We perform several parallel tests on two Linux clusters, showing that the convergence of the method is independent of the number of subdomains (scalability), the discretization parameters and the number of levels (optimality). Moreover the comparison with the traditional Block Jacobi ILU parallel preconditioner and the V-cycle Multigrid parallel preconditioner shows that, on a whole heart cycle simulation, the proposed method attains the best performances in terms of CPU times. &copy; 2008 Elsevier B.V.

It is shown that in the distinct diffusion coefficient case the eigenvalues of the matrix of the system of ordinary differential equations (obtained from the Laplace transformation of the PDEs) can be separated in the Laplace plane, which facilitates the derivation of the IEs. However, the IEs are found to be easily obtainable only in the case of sufficiently simple networks of homogeneous reactions, for which the matrices of rate constants are appropriately sparse. Further work is needed to develop mathematical and numerical techniques enabling the application of the IE method to complex reaction networks. &copy; 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract  = {This article is concerned with developing efficient discontinuous Galerkin methods for approximating viscosity (and classical) solutions of fully nonlinear second-order elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) including the Monge-Ampe&grave;re equation and the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. A general framework for constructing interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin (IP-DG) methods for these PDEs is presented. The key idea is to introduce multiple discrete Hessians for the viscosity solution as a means to characterize the behavior of the function. The PDE is rewritten in a mixed form composed of a single nonlinear equation paired with a system of linear equations that defines multiple Hessian approximations. To form the single nonlinear equation, the nonlinear PDE operator is replaced by the projection of a numerical operator into the discontinuous Galerkin test space. The numerical operator uses the multiple Hessian approximations to form a numerical moment which fulfills consistency and g-monotonicity requirements of the framework. The numerical moment will be used to design solvers that will be shown to help the IP-DG methods select the "correct" solution that corresponds to the unique viscosity solution. Numerical experiments are also presented to gauge the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed mixed IP-DG methods.Copyright &copy; 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The general solution can be used arbitrarily for over-damped, damped and undamped cases. In a damped or undamped case, one of the natural frequencies of the unperturbed equation may be a multiple of the other. Thus, the solution also covers the case of internal resonance which is an interesting and important part of non-linear oscillation. The determination of the solution is very simple and easier than the existing procedures developed by several authors (both in methods of averaging and multiple time scales) especially to tackle the case of internal resonance. The method is illustrated by an example of a fourth-order differential equation. The solution shows a good agreement with numerical solution in all of the three cases, e.g. over-damped, damped and undamped. &copy; 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract  = {Non-linear dynamic problems governed by ordinary (ODE) or partial differential equations (PDE) are herein approached by means of an alternative methodology. A generalized solution named WEM by the authors and previously developed for boundary value problems, is applied to linear and non-linear equations. A simple transformation after selecting an arbitrary interval of interest T allows using WEM in initial conditions problems and others with both initial and boundary conditions. When dealing with the time variable, the methodology may be seen as a time integration scheme. The application of WEM leads to arbitrary precision results. It is shown that it lacks neither numerical damping nor chaos which were found to be present with the application of some of the time integration schemes most commonly used in standard finite element codes (e.g., methods of central difference, Newmark, Wilson-&theta;, and so on). Illustrations include the solution of two non-linear ODEs which govern the dynamics of a single-degree-of-freedom (s.d.o.f.) system of a mass and a spring with two different non-linear laws (cubic and hyperbolic tangent respectively). The third example is the application of WEM to the dynamic problem of a beam with non-linear springs at its ends and subjected to a dynamic load varying both in space and time, even with discontinuities, governed by a PDE. To handle systems of non-linear equations iterative algorithms are employed. The convergence of the iteration is achieved by taking n partitions of T. However, the values of T/n are, in general, several times larger than the usual &Delta;t in other time integration techniques. The maximum error (measured as a percentage of the energy) is calculated for the first example and it is shown that WEM yields an acceptable level of errors even when rather large time steps are used.},

Linear stability analysis of SDIRK schemes and some numerical tests have been implemented and the results are presented. As a conclusion, these schemes generally perform well for the solution of the strongly nonlinear damping equations with smaller time steps, while increasing the time step results in oscillations or even instability. More stages or higher orders do not guarantee better performances. This study can be expanded later to investigate the performance of SDIRK schemes for the solution of nonlinear partial differential equations such as velocity and temperature diffusion in ABL.},

This algorithm is based on a band-diagonal matrix representation of the differential operator P(x,d/dx), though it is quite different from the usual Galerkin methods. This representation is made for the respective CONSs of the input Hilbert space  and the output Hilbert space <sup>&diam;</sup> of P(x,d/dx). This band-diagonal matrix enables the construction of a recursive algorithm for solving the ODE. However, a solution of the simultaneous linear equations represented by this matrix does not necessarily correspond to the true solution of ODE. We show that when this solution is an l<sup>2</sup>2 sequence, it corresponds to the true solution of ODE. We invent a method based on an integer-type algorithm for extracting only l<sup>2</sup>2 components. Further, the concrete choice of Hilbert spaces  and <sup>&diam;</sup> is also given for our algorithm when p<inf>m</inf> is a polynomial or a rational function with rational coefficients. We check how our algorithm works based on several numerical demonstrations related to special functions, where the results show that the accuracy of our method is extremely high (with several hundred or several thousand significant digits).

  abstract  = {In the present work the problem of determining the probabilistic structure of the dynamical response of nonlinear systems subjected to general, external, stochastic excitation is considered. The starting point of our approach is a Hopf-type equation, governing the evolution of the joint, response-excitation, characteristic functional. Exploiting this equation, we derive new linear partial differential equations governing the joint, response-excitation, characteristic (or probability density) function, which can be considered as an extension of the well-known Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation to the case of a general, correlated excitation and, thus, non-Markovian response character. These new equations are supplemented by initial conditions and a marginal compatibility condition (with respect to the known probability distribution of the excitation), which is of non-local character. The validity of this new equation is also checked by showing its equivalence with the infinite system of moment equations. The method is applicable to any differential system, in state-space form, exhibiting polynomial nonlinearities. In this paper the method is illustrated through a detailed analysis of a simple, first-order, scalar equation, with a cubic nonlinearity. It is also shown that various versions of Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation, corresponding to the case of independent-increment excitations, can be derived by using the same approach. A numerical method for the solution of these new equations is introduced and illustrated through its application to the simple model problem. It is based on the representation of the joint probability density (or characteristic) function by means of a convex superposition of kernel functions, which permits us to satisfy a priori the non-local marginal compatibility condition. On the basis of this representation, the partial differential equation is eventually transformed to a system of ordinary differential equations for the kernel parameters. Extension to general, multidimensional, dynamical systems exhibiting any polynomial nonlinearity will be presented in a forthcoming paper. &copy; 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In the usual splitting formulas the nonlinear equation systems are solved by Jacobian-based iteration methods. In general, the Jacobian matrices used have a simple structure (often tridiagonal). The linearly implicit splitting formulas directly involve approximations to the Jacobian matrices in the scheme so that only linear equation systems with simple coefficient matrices have to be solved. Furthermore, these formulas are consistent of order two and have good stability properties.},

  abstract  = {The past several years have yielded much research into the development of general numerical integrators for nonlinear unstructured higher index differential algebraic equations (DAEs) of the form $F(y\sp\prime,y,t)=0$ where $F\sb{y\sp\prime}$ is identically singular. These methods are based on integrating an implicitly defined ODE produced by forming the derivative array equations $G(y\sp\prime,w,y,t)=0.$ This larger nonlinear system may have components that are not uniquely determined. Prior work has examined the theoretical aspects of these methods. There has also been considerable work done on the efficient implementation of these integrators. This thesis will examine two initialization problems that arise when numerically solving DAEs. One problem is the computation of the consistent initial conditions required to begin the integration of DAEs. Various line search strategies will be compared and examples provided showing where these strategies are needed. The second problem is the initialization of the iterative solvers used during the integration of a DAE. Integration of the implicitly defined ODE depends on solving the nonlinear system $G=0$ at each time step. For fully implicit nonlinear systems the possible effects of polynomial prediction on the nonunique components will be examined. A complete analysis is given in the case of higher index linear time varying DAEs. It is shown that the standard ODE theory does not hold and a different prediction strategy must be used.

  abstract  = {B-spline methods are Linear Multistep Methods based on B-splines which have good stability properties [F. Mazzia, A. Sestini, D. Trigiante, B-spline multistep methods and their continuous extensions, SIAM J. Numer Anal. 44 (5) (2006) 1954-1973] when used as Boundary Value Methods [L. Brugnano, D. Trigiante, Convergence and stability of boundary value methods for ordinary differential equations, J. Comput. Appl. Math. 66 (1-2) (1996) 97-109; L. Brugnano, D. Trigiante, Solving Differential Problems by Multistep Initial and Boundary Value Methods, Gordon and Breach Science Publishers, Amsterdam, 1998]. In addition, they have an important feature: if k is the number of steps, it is always possible to associate to the numerical solution a C<sup>k</sup> spline of degree k + 1 collocating the differential equation at the mesh points. In this paper we introduce an efficient algorithm to compute this continuous extension in the general case of a non-uniform mesh and we prove that the spline shares the convergence order with the numerical solution. Some numerical results for boundary value problems are presented in order to show that the use of the information given by the continuous extension in the mesh selection strategy and in the Newton iteration makes more robust and efficient a Matlab code for the solution of BVPs. &copy; 2008 IMACS.},

  abstract  = {A novel mesh-free approach for solving differential equations based on Evolution Strategies (ESs) is presented. Any structure is assumed in the equations making the process general and suitable for linear and nonlinear ordinary and partial differential equations (ODEs and PDEs), as well as systems of ordinary differential equations (SODEs). Candidate solutions are expressed as partial sums of Fourier series. Taking advantage of the decreasing absolute value of the harmonic coefficients with the harmonic order, several ES steps are performed. Harmonic coefficients are taken into account one by one starting with the lower order ones. Experimental results are reported on several problems extracted from the literature to illustrate the potential of the proposed approach. Two cases (an initial value problem and a boundary condition problem) have been solved using numerical methods and a quantitative comparative is performed. In terms of accuracy and storing requirements the proposed approach outperforms the numerical algorithm. &copy; 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract  = {Many ordinary differential equations that describe physical phenomena possess solutions that cannot be obtained in closed form. To obtain the solutions to these systems, the use of numerical schemes is unavoidable. Traditional numerical analysis concerns itself with obtaining error bounds within finite closed time intervals; however, the study of asymptotic or long term behaviour of solutions generated by numerical schemes has attracted a lot of interest in recent years. It is now well established that numerical schemes for nonlinear autonomous differential equations can admit asymptotic solutions which do not correspond to those of the ODE. This thesis studies linearized one-point collocation methods, contributing to this important investigation by considering bifurcation phenomena in autonomous ODEs and studying the dynamics of the methods for nonautonomous ODEs. Using the theory of normal forms, it is established that the common codimension-1 bifurcations that exist in continuous dynamical systems will occur in the methods at the same phase space location. However, the methods can exhibit period doubling bifurcations, which are necessarily spurious. They also introduce a singular set, which drastically affects the global dynamics of the methods. The technique of stroboscopic sampling of the numerical solution is used to study the dynamics of nonautonomous ODEs with periodic solutions, and conditions under which the methods have a unique periodic solution that is asymptotically stable, are stated explicitly. A link between these conditions and nonautonomous linear and nonlinear stability theory is established.

  abstract  = {To solve atmospheric primitive equations, the finite difference approach would result in numerous problems, compared to the differential equations. Taking the semi-Lagrange model as an example, there exist two difficult problems-the particle trajectory computation and the solutions of the Helmholtz equations. In this study, based on the substitution of atmosphere pressure, the atmospheric primitive equations are linearized within an integral time step, which are broadly seen as ordinary differential equations and can be derived as semi-analytical solutions (SASs). The variables of SASs are continuous functions of time and discretized in a special direction, so the gradient and divergence terms are solved by the difference method. Since the numerical solution of the SASs can be calculated via a highly precise numerical computational method of exponential matrix-the precise integration method, the numerical solution of SASs at any time in the future can be obtained via step-by-step integration procedure. For the SAS methodology, the pressure, as well as the wind vector and displacement, can be obtained without solving the Helmholtz formulations. Compared to the extrapolated method, the SAS is more reasonable as the displacements of the particle are solved via time integration. In order to test the validity of the algorithms, the SAS model is constructed and the same experiment of a non-linear density current as reported by Straka in 1993 is implemented, which contains non-linear dynamics, transient features and fine-scale structures of the fluid flow. The results of the experiment with 50 m spatial resolution show that the SAS model can capture the characters of generation and development process of the Kelvin-Helmholtz shear instability vortex; the structures of the perturbation potential temperature field are very close to the benchmark solutions given by Straka, as well as the structures of the simulated atmosphere pressure and wind field. To further test the convergence of the numerical solution of the SAS model, the 100 m spatial resolution experiment of the non-linear density current is also implemented for comparison. Although the results from both experiments are similar, the former one is better and the property of mass-energy conservation is comparatively reasonable, and furthermore, the SAS model has a convergent property in the numerical solutions. Therefore, the SAS method is a new tool with efficiency for solving the atmospheric primitive equations. &copy; 2015 Chinese Physical Society.},

  abstract  = {Over the last decade several general-purpose numerical methods for ordinary differential equations (ODEs) have been developed which generate a continuous piecewise polynomial approximation that is defined for all values of the independent variable in the range of interest. For such methods it is possible to introduce measures of the quality of the approximate solution based on how well the piecewise polynomial satisfies the ODE. This leads naturally to the notion of `defect-control'. Numerical methods that adopt error estimation and stepsize selection strategies in order to control the magnitude of the associated defect can be very effective and such methods are now being widely used. In this paper we will review the advantages of this class of numerical methods and present examples of how they can be effectively applied. We will focus on numerical methods for initial value problems (IVPs) and boundary value problems (BVPs) where most of the developments have been introduced but we will also discuss the implications and related developments for other classes of ODEs such as delay differential equations (DDEs) and differential algebraic equations (DAEs).},

The purpose of this paper is to show that the maximum attainable order of a method in this class is five.

In Strength of Materials approach, the geometry, material properties and load system are known and related with the unknowns of forces, moments, slopes and deformations by applying a classical differential analysis in addition to equilibrium, constitutive, and kinematic laws. All these relations are expressed in a unified formulation for the classical beam theory. In the special case of simple beams, a system of four linear ordinary differential equations of first order represents the general mechanical behaviour of a straight beam. These equations are solved using the numerical differential quadrature method (DQM). The application of DQM has the advantages of mathematical consistency and conceptual simplicity. The numerical procedure is simple and gives clear understanding. This systematic way of obtaining influence line, bending moment, shear force diagrams and deformed shape for the beams with geometric and load discontinuities has been discussed in this paper. Buckling loads and natural frequencies of any beam prismatic or non-prismatic with any type of support conditions can be evaluated with ease.},

  abstract  = {Many technological applications need of differential models either for their microscopic or macroscopic description and, frequently, they involve non-linear equations. There is a class of differential models that is the diffusive-reaction type models that have a very large number of applications in different chemical engineering problems. These include transport and reaction in catalytic processes, heat and mass transfer in more than one phase, and electrostatic potentials in many current electrokinetic processes, just to name a few. Solutions to these models are either by linear approximations of the non-linear source, by other approximations of such non-linearity, or by numerical methods that frequently are heavily dependent of the mesh size for a successful convergence. In this contribution, an analytical-logarithmic approach is introduced and applied to unbounded domains of a rectangular, cylindrical, and spherical geometry for the case of electrostatic potential around a particle or an electrode in a given solution. Due to the lack of general methods to derive analytical solutions for differential models with non-linear sources, this study has focused on developing an efficient and economical procedure to obtain a formal analytical solution for such models that is used in a simple predictor-corrector approach to predict the correct solution. The proposed method involves the use of a recursive function, f<inf>AO</inf>, of the non-linear dependable variable that work as a corrector function. The procedure converts the non-linear ordinary differential equation in a simpler pseudo-linear ordinary differential equation whose analytical solution is later modified by means of the f<inf>AO</inf> correction function to obtain the correct solution. The start of the algorithmic approach uses the case of f<inf>AO</inf> = 1, that is the "true" solution to the linear approximation. Afterwards, the correction function is updated until convergence to the solution of the original non-linear equation is achieved. &copy; 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The inflation tests at the fixed axial extension of 1, 1.125, and 1.25 were conducted on the muscle and mucosa layer of a porcine esophagus separately and the pressure-radius-axial force was recorded. The experimental data were fitted with the constitutive model to obtain the structure-related parameters, including the collagen amount and fiber orientation. Results showed that a bilinear strain energy function (SEF) with four parameters could fit the inflation data at an individual extension very well while a six-parameter model had to be used to capture the inflation behaviors at all three extensions simultaneously. It was found that the collagen distribution was axial preferred in both layers and the mucosa contained more collagen, which were in agreement with the findings through a pair of uniaxial tensile test in our previous study. The model was expected to be used for the prediction of stress distribution within the esophageal wall under the physiological state and provide some useful information in the clinical studies of the esophageal diseases.

It is shown that there are two shear stiffness values associated with the Z-core sandwich panels, depending on the direction of the shear force. The stronger value of a typical panel can be 60% higher than the weaker value. To verify this phenomenon experimentally, two steel sandwich panels with different stiffener spacing were fabricated and tested. Good agreement was obtained between the theoretical predictions and the experimental results.},

  abstract  = {A simple analytical approach based on the Rankine principle has been developed to determine the ultimate resistance of steel frames in fire. The proposed Rankine approach gives an approximation of the frames' fire resistance through a simple interaction between two idealized structural behaviors-strength and stability. Here, the strength and stability of the structures are evaluated using the rigid-plastic and the elastic buckling analyses, both incorporating the thermal effects. The proposed approach is first verified using a finite-element model. The verification studies include the effects of column and frame slenderness ratios, beam-column stiffness ratio, steel grades, initial sway imperfections, and initial residual stresses. These studies indicate that frame slenderness ratio is an important parameter governing the behavior of simple frames in fire, and the performance of the proposed approach is related to it. The Rankine approach is then applied to a series of 18 test frames from the literature. It is shown that the proposed approach can provide predictions with sufficient accuracy for simple frames in fire.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, the differential quadrature method is used to solve first-order initial value problems. The initial condition is given at the beginning of a time interval. The time derivative at a sampling grid point within the time interval can be expressed as a weighted linear sum of the given initial condition and the function values at the sampling grid points within the time interval. The order of accuracy and the stability property of the quadrature solutions depend on the locations of the sampling grid points. It is shown that the order of accuracy of the quadrature solutions at the end of a time interval can be improved to 2n - 1 or 2n if the n sampling grid points are chosen carefully. In fact, the approximate solutions are equivalent to the generalized Pade&acute; approximations. The resultant algorithms are therefore unconditionally stable with controllable numerical dissipation. The corresponding sampling grid points are found to be given by the roots of the modified shifted Legendre polynomials. From the numerical examples, the accuracy of the quadrature solutions obtained by using the proposed sampling grid points is found to be better than those obtained by the commonly used uniformly spaced or Chebyshev-Gauss-Lobatto sampling grid points.

A full scale specimen was tested under cyclic quasi-static loadings to understand its performance under seismic loading. In the test, local buckling was first observed at the through brace in the intersection area. Then, a crack was found in the weld toe between the lap brace and the through brace. The propagation of the crack led to final failure of the joint. Some indicators to assess the performance of the joint were evaluated within the context of seismic resistance. The energy analysis indicated that the local buckling at the intersection area was the main energy dissipating mechanism. Comparison with an N-joint shows that the completely overlap joint performed better under seismic loadings. After calibration by the experimental results, an extensive finite element analysis was carried out to determine the main factors that have significant influence on the hysteresis behavior of the joint. &copy; 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The failure mode of the joint was due to the through brace face plastification. An ovalising effect of the through brace cross-section and bending on the gap region were noted. The onset of non-linear behaviour occurred at 72% of the ultimate load. The capacity of the joint was found to be 7.3% higher than that of the simple gap K-joint, which was determined from the ultimate strength formula. The deformation limit of the joint was 3.82 times the lap brace yield deformation. In the numerical study, the 8-node thick shell element was used to model the joint. No weld element was modelled, but the material with strain hardening property was necessary in the model. The comparison of the load-displacement curve with the experimental results showed a reasonably good agreement, with 5% less for both the ultimate load and the corresponding lap brace axial displacement. As the finite element method was verified to be reliable and accurate, a detailed parametric study was performed to intensively investigate the ultimate load behaviour of the completely overlapped joint as described in the companion paper on behavioural study. &copy; 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The effect of the gap length on the behaviour of the joints is also investigated. In the study, the end of the lap brace was axially loaded. Criteria were set up to determine the minimum failure load. It was found that a joint subjected to compression load gave the lowest ultimate capacity. The geometric parameters of the chord were shown to have an insignificant impact on the joint behaviour. The joint strength increased as the gap reduced. A sharp increase in the joint strength at small gap was noted for a relatively high &beta;<inf>TL</inf>(=d<inf>L</inf>/d<inf>T</inf>=0.768). The Y-joint capacity was reached at a sufficiently large gap. &tau;<inf>TL</inf>(=t<inf>L</inf>/t<inf>T</inf>) had a crucial influence on the joint failure behaviour.

The failure mechanisms changed from "chord" (through brace) bending, followed by localised plastification of the through brace face to yielding of the lap brace when the gap was reduced from a large gap to a small gap of 51 mm. &copy; 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Furthermore, the procedure can be generalized to construct unconditionally stable higher-order accurate time step integration algorithms for third- and higher-order initial value problems without any difficulties.

Here, the evaluation of column strength is based on the rigid-plastic theory, while the stability consideration is based on the elastic-buckling theory. By considering the two factors in this manner, the proposed approach allows for their interaction. One important feature is that the same analytical formula can be used for both axially and eccentrically loaded columns. In addition, the proposed formula does not require any calibrations against test data. The proposed formula has been verified against a set of published column test results and other analytical predictions.

  language  = {English},
  abstract  = {To ensure structural integrity after modification and/or retrofitting, the behavior of strengthened tubular joints needs to be understood. The finite-element method is a useful tool for studying the problem. However, this numerical technique has to be verified by experimental results before being used extensively. In this paper, the ultimate capacity of doubler plate-reinforced tubular joints is studied. To establish a reference point, a doubler plate-reinforced tubular T-joint was fabricated, instrumented, and tested to failure under axial compression brace loading. The structural behaviors were observed and analyzed. It was found that the ultimate capacity was greatly improved by the inclusion of the doubler plate. The experimental load-displacement curves were compared with the finite-element predictions and good agreement was obtained. The finite-element techniques were then verified and could be used to study the ultimate capacity. A behavioral study was then conducted by applying various types of brace loading and varying different geometric parameters, one at a time.},

  abstract  = {An all-steel sandwich panel consists of two steel facing flat plates spot-welded onto a core of stiffeners, which may consist of zed sections, tophats, channels or corrugated sheeting.Such panels have been studied extensively, and both numerical and analytical comparisons have been reported. This paper presents a modified thick plate approach for the analysis of sandwich panels. To better appreciate the development of the proposed method, a brief review of the previous modelling techniques-i.e. closed-form solution, grillage analogy and the conventional finite element modelling-is given. At the present time, the closed-form solution is not amenable to analysis of panels with penetration or support conditions other than simply-supported all round. Response predictions using the grillage analogy necessitates a regular grid, and, for a panel with small penetration, a very fine grid is required. The advanced finite element package is ideal as a research tool but it requires significant computing time and memory. The proposed modified thick plate analysis reported here obviates the difficulties mentioned above. In this technique,it is assumed that the three layers of steel plates i.e. the top and bottom facing plates and the core, may be 'compacted' into an equivalent single layer of characteristics of the sandwich panel are preserved. Comparisons of deflections are presented for the different methods. Available experimental data are also provided to verify the proposed technique.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, a precise time-step integration method for dynamic problems is presented. The second-order differential equations for dynamic problems are manipulated directly. A general damping matrix is considered. The transient responses are expressed in terms of the steady-state responses, the given initial conditions and the step-response and impulsive-response matrices. The steady-state responses for various types of excitations are readily obtainable. The computation of the step-response and impulsive-response matrices and their time derivatives are studied in this paper. A direct computation of these matrices using the Taylor series solutions is not efficient when the time-step size &Delta;t is not small. In this paper, the recurrence formulae relating the response matrices at t = &Delta;t to those at t = &Delta;t/2 are constructed. A recursive procedure is proposed to evaluate these matrices at t = &Delta;t from the matrices at t = &Delta;t/2<sup>m</sup>. The matrices at t = &Delta;t/2<sup>m</sup> are obtained from the Taylor series solutions. To improve the computational efficiency, the relations between the response matrices and their time derivatives are investigated. In addition, these matrices are expressed in terms of two symmetric matrices that can also be evaluated recursively. Besides, from the physical point of view, these matrices should be banded for small &Delta;t. Both the stability and accuracy characteristics of the present algorithm are studied. Three numerical examples are used to illustrate the highly precise and stable algorithm.},

A full-scale specimen was tested under cyclic quasi-static loading. In the test, local buckling was first observed around the lap brace and through-brace intersection. A crack was then developed at the weld toe between the lap brace and the through brace, and the propagation of the crack led to the final failure of the joint. Indicators to assess the performance of the joints were evaluated within the context of seismic resistance. The energy analysis indicated that the local buckling at the intersection area was the main energy-dissipating mechanism. A comparison with an N-joint showed that the completely overlapped joint performed better under seismic loadings. An extensive finite-element analysis showed that increasing the lap brace diameter could improve the hysteresis performance of the joint while changing the gap size and the wall thickness of the through brace would have limited effects.},

The algorithms are based on the Newmark method with complex time steps. The ultimate spectral radius (μ), the sub-step locations (βj) and the weighting factors (αj) are the algorithmic parameters. For an algorithm that is (2n−1)th order accurate, the sub-step locations which may be complex, are shown to be the roots of an nth degree polynomial. The polynomial is given explicitly in terms of n and μ. The weighting factors are then obtained by solving a system of n simultaneous equations. It is further shown that the order of accuracy is increased by one for the non-dissipative algorithms with μ=1. The stability properties of the present algorithms are studied. It is shown that if the ultimate spectral radius is set between −1 and 1, the eigenvalues of the numerical amplification matrix are complex with magnitude less than or equal to unity. The algorithms are therefore unconditionally C-stable. When the ultimate spectral radius is set to 0 or 1, the algorithms are found to be equivalent to the first sub-diagonal and diagonal Padé approximations, respectively. The present algorithms are more general as the numerical dissipation is controllable and are very suitable for parallel computers. The accuracy of the excitation responses is found to be enhanced by the present complex-time-step procedure. To maintain high-order accuracy, the excitation may need some modifications. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract             = {{Blast loading is often described by means of high order functions, and
   step-by-step time integration algorithms are commonly used to evaluate
   the numerical solutions. The time step size for the Newmark method has
   to be very small in order to integrate the high order loading
   accurately. Recently, a complex time step formulation has been proposed
   to construct unconditionally stable higher order accurate time step
   integration algorithms with controllable numerical dissipation where
   loading with high order variation can be tackled without difficulties.
   The responses at the end of a time step are obtained by linearly
   combining the responses at various complex sub-step locations with
   different weighting factors. In this paper, the complex time step method
   is extended to evaluate the responses within a time step. The required
   weighting factors anywhere within a time step can be worked out
   systematically. Besides, there are some locations within a time step
   with one order higher in accuracy. A procedure is also proposed to
   evaluate the modified excitation at various complex sub-step locations.
   To verify the complex time step method, a single-degree-of freedom
   system subject to blast loading described by a fourth order polynomial
   is considered in detail. A multi-degree-of-freedom system is also
   analyzed. Excellent performance over the Newmark method is noted. It is
   possible to evaluate the responses due to blast loading by using just
   one time step. (C) 1999 Academic Press.}},

To develop the proposed method, five Unconventional Hamilton-type Variational Principles tailor-made for truss-type structures were derived, preserving naturally all necessary conditions for the dynamic analysis without the introduction of any artificial factors. The resultant one-field and the two-filed formulations were used to build algorithms for the proposed method. The semi-discretisation treatment of the spatial and temporal domains was applied to these formulations. While the spatial discretisation was undertaken in the standard fashion, temporal discretisation was attempted with four different types of time finite elements. The convergence of the algorithms was examined in terms of the stability and the consistency properties. Numerical examples with different types of truss-type structures were given to verify the proposed method, and also to compare the performance of these algorithms against the existing analysis methods. The proposed algorithms were shown to be second- or higher-order accurate when various time finite elements were employed. Compared to the widely used Average Acceleration Method (AAM), the proposed method produces highly accurate results. Larger time steps can be used without compromising the accuracy hence the computational costs may be reduced. Therefore, the proposed method can provide a fast and high-precision analysis solution for applications where these attributes are desired.},

Developing the ideas following the original works in References ( Int. J. Numer. Meth. Engng 2004; 59 :597-668, Int. J. Numer. Meth. Engng 2004; 60 :1699-1740, Int. J. Numer. Meth.

Generalized single step single solve (GSSSS) optimal algorithm recently developed and basic well-known weighted-residual methods are compared with level-symmetric (LS) integration methods proposed. These LS methods are created as symmetric variants of extended three-level (3L-LMS) integration algorithm with direct use of dynamic equations to obtain algorithmically simple integration methods, which belong to [U0-V0] L-stable optimal class without overshoots and have the maximum damping of high-frequency modes. General formulas for L-stable family of multi-step LS-N methods are obtained. Standard two-level representation (2L-LMS) of 3L-LMS integration algorithm is also obtained, and L-stable second-order accurate LS-BDF integration method for the stiff first-order ordinary differential equations is proposed. Roots, dissipation and dispersion properties of LS-1 integration method (second-order accurate in displacement) and of other obtained LS-2, LS-3, LS-4 methods (third-order accurate in displacement) are analysed and demonstrated. Comparison with some up-to-date integration methods is considered in three numerical examples. Copyright 漏 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract  = {In this chapter, a second-order scheme of precise time-step integration (PTI) method is introduced for dynamic analysis with respect to long-term integration and transient responses while spatial discretization is realized with the differential quadrature method. Rather than transforming into first-order equations, a recursive scheme is presented in detail for direct solution of the homogeneous part of second-order differential and algebraic equations. The sine and cosine matrices involved in the scheme are calculated using the so-called N 2 algorithm, and the corresponding particular solution is also presented where the excitation vector is approximated by the truncated Taylor series. The performance and numerical behaviors of the second-order scheme of the PTI method are tested by a series of numerical examples in comparison with the first-order scheme or with the traditional time-marching Newmark-尾 method as the reference. The issue of spurious high-frequency responses resulting from spatial discretization for shock-excited structural dynamic analysis is also studied in the framework of the second-order PTI method. The effects of spatial discretization, numerical damping and time step on solution accuracy are explored by analyzing longitudinal vibrations of a shock-excited rod with rectangular, half-triangular and Heaviside step impact.},

In the conventional time integration methods, the required accuracy is always achieved by either decreasing the size of time steps or increasing the order of approximations. The proposed method, however, does not require a restriction on the size of the time step. The required approximating functions for integration of governing equations are determined using the concept of reproduction of the solution within each time step. A recurrence relationship is obtained through solving the governing equation by the point collocation based reproducing kernel method within the time step. In collocation points, the values of external excitation can be obtained either through the approximation between the values at the beginning and the end of each time step or assigning the exact values of the external force. Hence, one advantage of this new method is the independency of the sampling rates of external excitation from the size of the time step. The proposed method is applied for solving first and second order differential equations, and advantages of the method are illustrated through a number of numerical examples.},

If the displacement is assumed to be a polynomial of degree n+1 within the time interval, there are n+4 unknowns in the formulation. It is found that the order of accuracy would be at least n+1 for displacement and n for velocity in general. It is shown that the relevant algorithmic parameters for the second-order equations can be related to the algorithmic parameters presented in Part 1 of this paper for the first-order equations. Unconditionally stable higher order accurate time step integration algorithms with controllable numerical dissipation equivalent to the generalized Pad茅 approximations with an order of accuracy 2 n+3 can then be constructed systematically.

  abstract  = {Of general interest here is the time dimension aspect wherein discretized operators in time may be continuous or discontinuous; and of particular interest and focus here is the design of time operators in the context of discontinuous state-phase for computational dynamics applications. Based on a generalized bi-discontinuous time weighted residual formulation, the design leading to a new unified set of hierarchical energy conserving and energy decaying time discretized operators are developed for the first time that are fundamentally useful for dynamic computations. Unlike time discontinuous Galerkin approaches, the design is based upon a time discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin-like approach employing asymptotic series type approximations involving values of derivatives of state variable at the beginning of time step for approximating the state variables. As a consequence, this enables to design methods that have spectral properties corresponding to the diagonal, first sub-diagonal and second sub-diagonal Pade&acute; approximations. Thus, A-stable schemes of order 2q, L-stable schemes of order 2q - 1 and 2q - 2 are obtained. The spectral equivalent algorithms to diagonal Pade&acute; approximations are energy conserving algorithms. The spectral equivalent algorithms to first and second sub-diagonal Pade&acute; approximations are energy decaying algorithms with the property of asymptotic annihilation of the high-frequency response. Since Pade&acute; approximations have the lowest relative error the developed schemes are optimal in terms of order of accuracy in time, dissipation, dispersion and zero-order displacement and velocity overshoot characteristics. Additionally, the time operators that are spectrally equivalent to the diagonal, first sub-diagonal, and second sub-diagonal Pade&acute; exponential maps naturally inherit a hierarchical structure that are extremely useful for time adaptive computations.},

  abstract  = {Frequency response analysis in structural dynamics usually requires solving large dynamical systems of the form (-&omega;<sup>2</sup>M + i&omega;D + K)u(&omega;) = f (&omega;), which result from a FE discretization. A straightforward solution of big systems requires a high computational cost; therefore several Model Order Reduction (MOR) techniques have been developed in the last decades to obtain faster and efficient results. Between them interpolatory approaches have gained importance for solving second order dynamical systems. This work presents and compares ten MOR techniques which are suitable for structural dynamics problems. These are: Guyan-Irons Reduction, Improved Reduction System, Dynamic Reduction, Real Modal Analysis, Complex Modal Analysis, Craig-Bampton Method, and Interpolatory MOR methods like Multi-point Pad&eacute; Approximation, the Krylov-based Galerkin Projection and the Derivativebased Galerkin Projection. A brief summary of the theoretical background is presented for each method. A first numerical example shows the applicability for damped systems and a second example shows suitability of the Interpolatory MOR methods for industrial applications, using data from a commercial FE software (ANSYS&reg;).},

  abstract  = {In many engineering problems, the behavior of dynamical systems depends on physical parameters. In design optimization, these parameters are determined so that an objective function is minimized. For applications in vibrations and structures, the objective function depends on the frequency response function over a given frequency range, and we optimize it in the parameter space. Because of the large size of the system, numerical optimization is expensive. In this paper, we propose the combination of Quasi-Newton type line search optimization methods and Krylov-Pade&acute; type algebraic model order reduction techniques to speed up numerical optimization of dynamical systems. We prove that Krylov-Pade&acute; type model order reduction allows for fast evaluation of the objective function and its gradient, thanks to the moment matching property for both the objective function and the derivatives towards the parameters. We show that reduced models for the frequency alone lead to significant speed ups. In addition, we show that reduced models valid for both the frequency range and a line in the parameter space can further reduce the optimization time. &copy; 2012 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract  = {Frequency-based methods were set up in order to circumvent the limits of classical finite element methods in fast dynamic simulations due to discretizations. In this approach the dynamic loading was shifted in the frequency domain by FFT, then treated by the Variational Theory of Complex Rays, and then the time response was reconstructed through an IFFT. This strategy proved to be very efficient due to the CPU VTCR very low cost. However in the case of a large loading spectrum this frequency-by-frequency approach could seriously degrade the computational performances of the strategy. This paper addresses this point by proposing the use of Pad&eacute; approximants in order to limit the number of frequencies at which the response should be calculated. Pad&eacute; approximation is applied to the overall VTCR system based on its frequency dependency. Finally, as simulations on a simple academic case and on a civil engineering structure show, this method is found to be very efficient for interpolating the frequency response functions of a complex structure. This is a key point to preserve the efficiency of the complete VTCR strategy for transient dynamic problems. &copy; 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract  = {The response of a random dynamical system is totally characterized by its probability density function (pdf). However, determining a pdf by a direct approach requires a high numerical cost; similarly, surrogate models such as direct polynomial chaos expansions are not generally efficient, especially around the eigenfrequencies of the dynamical system. In the present study, a new approach based on Pad&eacute; approximants to obtain moments and pdf of the dynamic response in the frequency domain is proposed. A key difference between the direct polynomial chaos representation and the Pad&eacute; representation is that the Pad&eacute; approach has polynomials in both numerator and denominator. For frequency response functions, the denominator plays a vital role as it contains the information related to resonance frequencies, which are uncertain. A Galerkin approach in conjunction with polynomial chaos is proposed for the Pad&eacute; approximation. Another physics-based approach, utilizing polynomial chaos expansions of the random eigenmodes, is proposed and compared with the proposed Pad&eacute; approach. It is shown that both methods give accurate results even if a very low degree of the polynomial expansion is used. The methods are demonstrated for two degree-of-freedom system with one and two uncertain parameters. Copyright &copy; 2016 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. Copyright &copy; 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

Explicit and implicit methods are evaluated for stability and accuracy in terms of the frequency spectrum of the continuum as well as discrete solution. The closed form of the discrete spectrum of a bar and beam are given to illustrate inherent errors of a spatial discretization. Additional errors of a direct time integration scheme are interpreted in terms of the discrete modes. The Newmark family of second-order difference approximations is found superior to either the original or extended Wilson methods, and to that of Houboult. Less than half as many time steps are required for comparable accuracy. If an upper bound on the highest frequency of a system is found, an optimum algorithm for a given time step can be found, rather than the usual selection of a time step for a given algorithm. The algorithmic damping admitted by the Newmark family can be controlled as a 鈥渓inear artificial viscosity鈥 to smooth shock discontinuities without the excessive damping of the Wilson and Houboult methods. The implications of these algorithms in wave propagation problems are illustrated.},

With adjustment of integration points in the stiffness, the softening or stiffening properties of discretized model for heat transfer problems can be altered. In addition, it is found that the integration points in the mass have a great effect on the critical time step for the explicit formulation of transient heat transfer problems. With a proper selection of integration points in the mass, a much larger time step can be applied in the analysis of transient heat transfer problems. Furthermore, it is observed that the final steady solutions of transient heat transfer problems are identical regardless of locations of integration points in the mass model. Numerical experiments including 2D heat transfer problems with different boundary conditions including heat conduction, heat convection and radiation are studied to verify the properties of flexible integration points in the stiffness and mass.},

Numerous research efforts focused on the stability and accuracy of different integration algorithms for linear elastic structures. However, investigations of those properties applied to nonlinear structures are limited. Systematic Lyapunov stability and accuracy analyses of several direct integration algorithms for nonlinear structural dynamics are presented. These integration algorithms include the implicit methods of the Newmark family of integration algorithm and the TRBDF2 algorithm, and the explicit methods of operator-splitting (OS) algorithms. Two versions of the OS algorithms, using initial and tangent stiffness formulations, are investigated. The latter one is shown to possess similar stability properties to the implicit Newmark integration. Some arguments of stability regarding these direct integration algorithms from past studies are found to be groundless. An approach that enables performing the stability analysis numerically is proposed. It transforms the stability analysis to a problem of convex optimization. In addition, accuracy of the previously discussed five integration algorithms is investigated using a geometrically nonlinear test problem, in which acceptable amounts of period elongation and amplitude decay were evident.},

  abstract   = {Simulation of dynamic adhesive peeling problems at small scales has attracted little attention so far. These problems are characterized by a highly nonlinear response. Accurate and stable time integration schemes are required for simulation of dynamic peeling problems. In the present work, a composite time integration scheme is proposed for the simulation of dynamic adhesive peeling problems. It is shown through numerical examples that the proposed scheme remains stable and also has some gain in accuracy. The performance of the scheme is compared with two collocation-based schemes, i.e., Newmark scheme and Bathe composite scheme. It is shown that the proposed scheme and Bathe composite scheme perform equally. However, the proposed scheme adds very little to the computational cost of Newmark scheme. Through a numerical simulation of the peeling of a gecko spatula from a rigid substrate it is shown that the proposed scheme and the Bathe composite scheme are able to simulate the complete peeling process for given time step whereas the Newmark scheme diverges. It is also shown that the maximum pull-off force is within the range reported in the literature.},

Direct integration schemes are important tools used in the dynamic analysis of many structures. It is critical that the solutions obtained from these schemes produce accurate results. Currently, one of the most widely used direct integration schemes is the trapezoidal rule. It is favored because it is a method that requires single steps and its results are second-order accurate. However, in cases where there are large deformations and longer integration times, the trapezoidal rule fails. A new composite method scheme shows promise in maintaining stability where the trapezoidal rule fails. It is a two step method that makes use of the trapezoidal rule and the three-point Euler backward method. The purpose of this study is to compare the trapezoidal rule and the new composite method using two nonlinear problems in order to determine if the composite method generates more accurate results than the trapezoidal rule. by Jennifer D.

The method is based upon the formulation of solid dynamics equations as a parametric problem, depending on their initial conditions. A sort of black-box integrator that takes the resulting displacement field of the current time step as input and (via POD) provides the result for the subsequent time step at feedback rates on the order of 1 kHz is obtained. To avoid the so-called curse of dimensionality produced by the large amount of parameters in the formulation (one per degree of freedom of the full model), a combined POD–PGD strategy is implemented. Examples that show the promising results of this technique are included. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Two Chang-α dissipative family methods and two KR-α family methods were developed for time integration recently. Although the four family methods are in the category of the dissipative structure-dependent integration methods, their performances may be drastically different due to the detrimental property of weak instability or overshoot for the two KR-α family methods. This weak instability or overshoot will result in an adverse overshooting behavior or even numerical instability. In general, the four family methods can possess very similar numerical properties, such as unconditional stability, second-order accuracy, explicit formulation and controllable numerical damping. However, the two KR-α family methods are found to possess a weak instability property or overshoot in the high frequency responses to any nonzero initial conditions and thus this property will hinder them from practical applications. Whereas, the two Chang-α dissipative family methods have no such an adverse property. As a result, the performances of the two Chang-α dissipative family methods are much better than for the two KR-α family methods. Analytical assessments of all the four family methods are conducted in this work and numerical examples are used to confirm the analytical predictions.},

We apply cubic B-splines for spatial variable and its derivatives, which produce a system of first order ordinary differential equations. We solve this system by using SSP-RK3 scheme. The numerical approximate solutions to the nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations have been computed without transforming the equation and without using the linearization. Four illustrative examples are included to demonstrate the validity and applicability of the technique. In numerical test problems, the performance of this method is shown by computing L∞andL2error norms for different time levels.

Both conservative and non-conservative systems were examined. The results show that it isn’t unconditionally stable for the precise integration method, the Newmark method and the generalized-a method in nonlinear systems. The stable interval of the three methods is less than that of the CEMDTS. When a small time step(?t≤Tmin/20) is employed, the precise integration method is endowed with the highest accuracy while the CEMDTS possesses the smallest computation effort. However, the CEMDTS becomes the most accurate one when the time step is large(?t≥0.3Tmin) or the system is strongly nonlinear.

  abstract   = {A comprehensive study of the two sub-steps composite implicit time
   integration scheme for the structural dynamics is presented in this
   paper. A framework is proposed for the convergence accuracy analysis of
   the generalized composite scheme. The local truncation errors of the
   acceleration, velocity, and displacement are evaluated in a rigorous
   procedure. The presented and proved accuracy condition enables the
   displacement, velocity, and acceleration achieving second-order accuracy
   simultaneously, which avoids the drawback that the acceleration accuracy
   may not reach second order. The different influences of numerical
   frequencies and time step on the accuracy of displacement, velocity, and
   acceleration are clarified. The numerical dissipation and dispersion and
   the initial magnitude errors are investigated physically, which measure
   the errors from the algorithmic amplification matrix's eigenvalues and
   eigenvectors, respectively. The load and physically undamped/damped
   cases are naturally accounted. An optimal algorithm-Bathe composite
   method ( Bathe and Baig, 2005; Bathe, 2007; Bathe and Noh, 2012) is
   revealed with unconditional stability, no overshooting in displacement,
   velocity, and acceleration, and excellent performance compared with many
   other algorithms. The proposed framework also can be used for accuracy
   analysis and design of other multi-sub-steps composite schemes and
   single-step methods under physical damping and/or loading. Copyright (C

Methods that are unconditionally stable in linear analyses appear to be a natural choice for use in nonlinear analyses, but unfortunately may not remain stable for a given time step size in large deformation and long time range response solutions. A composite time integration scheme is proposed and tested in some example solutions against the trapezoidal rule and the Wilson 胃 -method, and found to be effective where the trapezoidal rule fails to produce a stable solution.

When first introduced, however, valuable information related to the accuracy, stability and merits of the method were not provided. It is shown that the modified Euler method has features that make it an attractive approach for applications in dynamic analyses of structures. Accuracy and stability analyses are made for the method by considering free-vibrational responses of linear, undamped, single-degree-of-freedom systems. The method is explicit and extremely easy to use. However, it is conditionally stable. Applications of the method are also made which illustrate its usefulness and inherent simplicity. Furthermore, comparisons of the modified Euler method and the Newmark beta method are reported which elucidate the relative merits of these methods.},

  abstract  = {In this article, we develop a novel stable time integration scheme for the transient analysis of structural dynamics problems. A second-order (in time) differential operator equation (e.g. obtained after finite element discretization in space) is written as a pair of first-order equations in terms of displacements and velocities. Then the solution is sought by minimizing the inner product of the residuals in the two equations (an unconventional approach) over typical time interval to obtain a symmetric set of algebraic equations involving displacements and velocities at two subsequent intervals. The new time integration scheme is termed the cross weighted-residual (CWR) time integration scheme because each of the two residuals takes the other one as a weight function in the minimization. The CWR time integration scheme is developed by using a uniform linear time approximation of the displacement and velocity fields to yield only a single step time integration scheme, which is comparable to the Newmark family of time integration scheme. A reduced integration technique is used to prevent velocity locking, which is caused by linear approximation of both the displacement and velocity fields. For the verification of the consistency and the stability, the CWR time integration scheme is tested with single-degree as well as multi-degree of freedom problems. The scheme performs extremely well compared with those of the well-known Newmark family of time integration schemes.},

  abstract     = {Integration algorithms are typically utilized in structural dynamics to obtain solution to the temporally discretized equations of motion. Stability is an important issue to be considered when selecting the proper integration algorithm for analysis of structures with a large number of degrees of freedom. Recent development of real-time structural testing brings more challenges to researchers selecting appropriate integration algorithms. An explicit algorithm is more favorable because of its computational efficiency but often constrained by its conditional stability. Moreover, numerical errors often lead to the spurious growth of high-frequency response in the dynamic analysis and the presence of inevitable experimental errors will aggravate this effect in real-time structural testing. It is therefore desirable for an explicit algorithm to not only have unconditional stability but also possess numerical damping to suppress any spurious participation of the high-frequency response while the lower modes can be integrated accurately. This paper presents the development of an unconditionally stable explicit integration algorithm with controllable numerical damping using discrete control theory.},

However, it suffers from low convergence rate. In the current study, a residual energy minimizer timestep (REMT) will be formulated by minimizing the residual energy. A variety of structural analyses with linear and nonlinear (elastic large deflection) behaviors demonstrate the potential of the proposed strategy. The results indicate that the REMT improves the convergence rate of DR without any additional constraints so that the cost and computational time are decreased.},

This paper intends to apply a set of analytical-numerical methods to estimate the region of attraction for autonomous nonlinear systems. In mechanical and structural engineering, autonomous systems could be found in large deformation problems or control of structures. In order to have an appropriate estimation of stability domain, some suitable Lyapunov functions are calculated by satisfying the modified Zubov's partial differential equation in a finite area around the asymptotically stable equilibrium point. To achieve this, the techniques of Collocation, Galerkin, Least squares, Moments and Sub-domain are applied. Furthermore, a number of numerical examples are solved by the suggested techniques and Zubov's construction procedure. In most cases, the proposed approaches compared with Zubov's scheme give a better estimation stability domain.},

  abstract  = {This work focuses on devising an efficient hierarchy of higher-order methods for linear transient analysis, equipped with an effective dissipative action on the spurious high modes of the response. The proposed strategy stems from the N酶rsett idea and is based on a multi-stage algorithm, designed to hierarchically improve accuracy while retaining the desired dissipative behaviour. Computational efficiency is pursued by requiring that each stage should involve just one set of implicit equations of the size of the problem to be solved (as standard time integration methods) and, in addition, all the stages should share the same coefficient matrix. This target is achieved by rationally formulating the methods based on the discontinuous collocation approach. The resultant procedure is shown to be well suited for adaptive solution strategies. In particular, it embeds two natural tools to effectively control the error propagation. One estimates the local error through the next-stage solution, which is one-order more accurate, the other through the solution discontinuity at the beginning of the current time step, which is permitted by the present formulation. The performance of the procedure and the quality of the two error estimators are experimentally verified on different classes of problems. Some typical numerical tests in transient heat conduction and elasto-dynamics are presented. Copyright 漏 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  title     = {Effective implementation of a time discontinuous Galerkin method},
  abstract  = {Abstract This work deals with time integration methods for linear dynamics. The semidiscrete equations are generally derived from standard finite element procedures and only a few low-frequency modes are accurate approximations of the underlying continuous problem. Thus, the quality of simulations depends crucially on the accuracy properties of the time integration method in the low-frequency modes, as well as on the dissipative properties in the high-frequency ones. The Time Discontinuous Galerkin (TDG) method possesses these desirable properties and has been successfully applied to linear dynamics (see e.g. (1)). Despite its good properties, it typically leads to systems of coupled equations which are larger than the original one, so that standard implementations are very demanding for both storage and computational work. Thus, developing effective implementations plays a key role in the practical application of the method. The purpose of this work is to establish an efficient iterative procedure to implement the TDG method. Differently from previous implementations (see e.g. (2) and (3)), the present procedure is designed to generate a sequence of updated values for displacements and velocities, by searching for the TDG solution while preserving the TDG stability and dissipative properties at each iteration. Improving only accuracy is demanded to iterative corrections. The idea for the iterative scheme stems from the implementation of the N酶rsett methods (4). The scheme is established so to obtain at the first iteration a N酶rsett approximant with the target stability and dissipative properties. The resultant procedure is simple and offers several advantages. Remarkable computational savings are achieved since the iterative corrections are performed using the same iteration matrix, which retains the structure of the original system and can be factorized only once for each fixed time step size. No more than two iterations are needed to obtain the same overall accuracy of the TDG method. Second order accuracy is achieved at the first iteration and third order accuracy at the second one.

  title     = {Effective higher-order methods for linear dynamics},
  abstract  = {ABSTRACT  This work presents a simple and efficient iterative procedure aimed at improving the properties of N酶rsett methods for linear dynamics towards those of Pad茅 methods. The procedure is used to implement a set of higher-order methods with controllable dissipation, recently presented by the authors. Some numerical tests demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed implementation. Competitive time stepping methods for finite element analysis in linear dynamics should possess certain peculiar attributes. In addition to unconditional stability, the salient properties are higher-order accuracy and controllable dissipation in the spurious high modes. Higher-order accuracy is crucial for long-term simulations in order to avoid an excessive accumulation of error. Moreover, some amount of dissipation in the higher modes is desirable in order to damp out their response, as it is well known that only a few low-frequency modes of the semidiscrete problem are accurate approximations to the modes of the original continuous problem. Indeed, the dissipative properties of most of the established A-and L-stable methods can be unsatisfactory. A-stable methods can damp out the high-frequency modes too slowly and spurious effects can show up. On the other hand, L-stable methods can introduce excessive dissipation in the low-mode response and this can affect the accuracy especially in long-term simulations. Therefore, a specific algorithmic parame-ter should be available to control the amount of numerical dissipation according to the importance of the spurious modal components.},

A new type of general linear method for the numerical solution of stiff differentialequations has been discovered recently. These methods are characterised by aproperty known as "inherent Runge-Kutta stability". This property implies thatthe stability matrix has only a single non-zero eigenvalue and that this eigenvalueis a rational approximation to the exponential function. This rational approximationis just like the stability function of a Runge-Kutta method. The theoreticalproperties of the new methods, such as stability and order, are surveyed. Alsoconstructing practical general linear methods of this type for stiff problems isdiscussed.The emphasis of the thesis is on implementation and numerical experiments.We have investigated several implementation questions such as starting methods,prediction of the stage values, an efficient iteration scheme, truncation error estimationand stepsize control. For each of these questions, numerical tests havebeen carried out.To investigate a fixed order general linear method, a starting method is neededto provide the first incoming approximations. It is to be expected that a goodprediction of the initial iteration in the Newton method calculations will reducethe number of iterations required. Since the LU factorizations are expensive, wehave designed an efficient iteration scheme to reduce the computational cost. Areliable error estimator gives an optimal stepsize sequence. These implementationissues are addressed in detail.},

Firstly theory of application of MOL on Burger's equation presented. Secondly we considers some examples to show goodness of new method. Computational results using a code based on our method are presented for this examples .

Starting from 'offering good solution to differential equations' to capturing the nonlinearity in the data distribution, wavelets are used as appropriate tools that provide good mathematical model for scientific phenomena, which are usually modeled through linear or nonlinear differential equations. Review shows that the Haar wavelet method (HWM) is efficient and powerful in solving wide class of linear and nonlinear differential equations. The discrete wavelet transform has gained the reputation of being a very effective signal analysis tool for many practical applications. This review intends to provide the great utility of Haar wavelets to science and engineering problems which owes its origin to 1910. Besides future scope and directions involved in developing Haar wavelet algorithm for solving differential equations are addressed.

  abstract  = {In this paper, an explicit time integration scheme is proposed for structural vibration analysis by using wavelet functions. Initially, the differential equation of vibration governing SDOF (single-degree of freedom) systems has been solved by wavelet operators, and later the proposed approach has been generalized for MDOF (multi-degrees of freedom) systems. For this purpose, two different types of wavelet functions have been exemplified including, complex Chebyshev wavelet functions and simple Haar wavelet functions. In the proposed approach, a straightforward formulation has been derived from the numerical approximation of response through the wavelet definition. Emphasizing on frequency-domain approximation, a simple step-by-step algorithm has been implemented and improved to calculate the response of MDOF systems. Moreover, stability and accuracy of results have been evaluated. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated using three examples compared with some of the existing numerical integration schemes such as family of Newmark-尾, Wilson-胃 and central difference method. In all the procedures, computation time involved has also been considered. Finally, it is concluded that the vibration analysis of structures is improved by lesser computation time and high accuracy of proposed approach, particularly, in large-scaled systems.},

  abstract  = {Wavelet solution techniques have become the focus of interest among researchers in different disciplines of science and technology. In this paper, implementation of two different wavelet basis functions has been comparatively considered for dynamic analysis of structures. For this aim, computational technique is developed by using free scale of simple Haar wavelet, initially. Later, complex and continuous Chebyshev wavelet basis functions are presented to improve the time history analysis of structures. Free-scaled Chebyshev coefficient matrix and operation of integration are derived to directly approximate displacements of the corresponding system. In addition, stability of responses has been investigated for the proposed algorithm of discrete Haar wavelet compared against continuous Chebyshev wavelet. To demonstrate the validity of the wavelet-based algorithms, aforesaid schemes have been extended to the linear and nonlinear structural dynamics. The effectiveness of free-scaled Chebyshev wavelet has been compared with simple Haar wavelet and two common integration methods. It is deduced that either indirect method proposed for discrete Haar wavelet or direct approach for continuous Chebyshev wavelet is unconditionally stable. Finally, it is concluded that numerical solution is highly benefited by the least computation time involved and high accuracy of response, particularly using low scale of complex Chebyshev wavelet.},

  abstract  = {ABSTRACT This textbook presents a comprehensive overview of different applications of the Haar wavelet method. As known, the simplest wavelets are the Haar wavelets which are orthogonal, piecewise constant functions. The Haar wavelet method has some preferences, such as mathematical simplicity, existence of fast algorithms, and high accuracy for a small number of grid points. Thus very often the Haar wavelet method is simpler and faster than other methods. This useful book is mainly written for students and researchers in applied mathematics, physics and engineering. The authors demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the Haar wavelet method by numerous examples. All computations are realized by Matlab programs. This textbook consists of 14 chapters. The first two chapters introduce the Haar wavelets. In Chapters 3-5, the Haar wavelet method is applied to the numerical solution of ordinary differential equations, integral equations, and integro-differential equations. In order to solve a linear differential equation of order n, the n-th derivative is approximated by a finite Haar wavelet expansion (with unknown wavelet coefficients). Then all derivatives of lower order are calculated by integration. Substituting these expansions into the differential equation by collocation, one obtains a linear system for the wavelet coefficients which is to solve. In the Chapters 6 and 7, some partial differential equations are solved by the Haar wavelet method. A Haar wavelet solution of fractional integral equations is described in Chapter 8. Then, in Chapter 9, Haar wavelets are applied in optimal control theory. In Chapters 10-14, Haar wavelets are used for problems in structural mechanics, such as buckling of elastic beams and vibrations of elastic beams.},

  abstract  = {The companion paper "Higher-order in time quasi-unconditionally stable ADI solvers for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations in 2D and 3D curvilinear domains," which is referred to as Part I in what follows, introduces ADI (alternating direction implicit) solvers of higher orders of temporal accuracy (orders s = 2 to 6) for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations in two- and three- dimensional space. The proposed methodology employs the backward differentiation formulae (BDF) together with a quasilinear-like formulation, high-order extrapolation for nonlinear components, and the Douglas-Gunn splitting. A variety of numerical results presented in Part I demonstrate in practice the theoretical convergence rates enjoyed by these algorithms, as well as their excellent accuracy and stability properties for a wide range of Reynolds numbers. In particular, the proposed schemes enjoy a certain property of "quasi-unconditional stability": For small enough (problem- dependent) fixed values of the time step &Delta;t, these algorithms are stable for arbitrarily fine spatial discretizations. The present contribution presents a mathematical basis for the observed performance of these algorithms. Short of providing stability theorems for the full Navier-Stokes BDF-ADI solvers, this paper puts forth a number of stability proofs for BDF-ADI schemes as well as some related unsplit BDF schemes for a variety of related linear model problems in one, two, and three spatial dimensions. These include proofs of quasi-unconditional stability for unsplit BDF schemes of orders 2 &le; s &le; 6, and even a proof of a form of unconditional stability for two-dimensional BDF-ADI schemes of order 2 for both convection and diffusion problems. Additionally, a set of numerical tests presented in this paper for the compressible Navier-Stokes equation indicate that quasi-unconditional stability carries over to the fully nonlinear context. &copy; by SIAM 2017.},

  abstract  = {An iterative method is needed when implicit integration method is used to integrate the independent coordinates of differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) which come from multibody system dynamics. If the iterative method is Newton's method, numerical differentiation is needed to obtain the Jacobian matrix. A fixed-point iterative method without the using of the Jacobian matrix can simplify the progress. The nonlinear algebraic constraint equations in DAEs are also solved by iteration to obtain the dependent coordinates. A two-loop structure is designed to manage those two iterations. The numerical accuracy of the integration method influences the numbers of iteration of implicit integration method which is called as the outer loop. Backward differential formulation (BDF) is introduced as the integration method into the two-loop method. New strategy is proposed to constitute the new two-loop method. The numbers of iteration of outer loop in the new two-loop method are reduced, and the computational efficiency is improved. The new two-loop method can solve the DAEs of multibody system dynamics well, and its universality is good. Numerical examples are provided. &copy; 2016 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.},

  abstract  = {We present an adaptive algorithm for time integration of fluid-structure integration problems. The method relies on a fully coupled procedure to solve FSI problems in which a naturally GCL-compliant ALE formulation for the finite-element spatial discretization is used. The main originality of the proposed solution procedure is that time integration is performed using automatic order and stepsize selections (hp-adaptivity) based on the Backward Differentiation Formulas (BDF). The stepsize selection is based on a local error estimate, an error controller and a step rejection mechanism. It guarantees that the solution precision is within the user targeted tolerance. The order selection is based on a stability test and a quarantine mechanism. The selection is performed to ensure that no other methods within the family of 0-stable BDF methods would produce a solution of the targeted precision for a larger stepsize (and thus a lower computational time). To improve efficiency, the time integration procedure also relies on a modified Newton method and a predictor. The time adaptive algorithm behaviors and performances are assessed on the vortex-induced translational and rotational vibrations of a square cylinder and on the wake-induced vibrations of 3 cylinders in an in-line arrangement. The algorithm yields substantial CPU time savings (compared to constant stepsize and order integration) while delivering solutions of prescribed accuracies. &copy; 2015 Elsevier B.V..},

The adaptive algorithm performs both stepsize and order selection to control respectively the solution accuracy and the computational efficiency of the time integration process. The stepsize selection (h-adaptivity) is based on a local error estimate and an error controller to guarantee that the numerical solution accuracy is within a user prescribed tolerance. The order selection (p-adaptivity) relies on the idea that low-accuracy solutions can be computed efficiently by low order time integrators while highly accurate solutions require high order time integrators to keep computational time low. Hence, the algorithm selects the most appropriate method within the formulas of order 1 to 5 based on the prescribed solution accuracy and equation stiffness. Doing so it guarantees that the variable stepsize BDF methods used always are stable during the whole time integration interval. The adaptive algorithm behaviors and performances are illustrated on the flow over a circular cylinder at low Reynolds numbers.},

This paper considers three ways of transformer iron-core modeling relevant for ferroresonance simulations that are presented in detail. The presented transformer models are suitable for the state-space form of differential equation systems that describe the ferroresonance effect. Before solving the obtained differential equation systems, their numerical eigenvalues were analyzed in detail. This eigenvalue analysis has revealed a very stiff nature of the obtained equation systems. The obtained equation systems are solved by using a A-and L-stable numerical differentiation formulas (NDF) numerical technique, with the aim of suppressing undesired numerical oscillations. The obtained numerical results are verified by comparison against the available experimental results. The presented analysis shows that the suggested transformer model based on a hysteretic core inductor provides the most accurate results in terms of voltage and current waveforms and their peak values during the steady-state and transient ferroresonance. The analyzed transformer core models can be implemented in the existing Electromagnetic Transients Program-type simulation tools by using a combination of the trapezoidal and proposed NDF2 method. &copy; 1986-2012 IEEE.},

We solve this linear system by means of the GMRES method by employing a multigrid (ML) right preconditioner for the parallel setting.

It is shown that, if the image matrix (preconditioner origin) is firstly preprocessed (scaled, normalized and reordered), a high quality ILU preconditioner is achieved. Numerical experiments considering different test-systems and different operation conditions illustrate how tricky can be the simulation of power system dynamics if the Jacobian matrix (coefficient matrix) is ill-conditioned, normally associated to an adverse operation condition. It is shown that a traditional implicit integration method may fail in this case, whereas the combination BDF-GMRES presents an outstanding performance. &copy; 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In previous papers the authors of this paper showed two algorithms for solving DMREs based on an iterative Generalized Minimum RESidual (GMRES) approach and on a Fixed-Point approach. In this paper we present two contributions to improve the above algorithms. Firstly six variants of previous algorithms are carried out by using one of above algorithms in the first step and another algorithm to carry out the other steps until reaching convergence. Numerous tests on four case studies have been done comparing both precision and computational costs of MATLAB implementations of the above algorithms. Experimental results show that in some cases these algorithms improve on the speed and convergence of the original algorithms. Secondly, using the previous experimental results and since all algorithms have a similar structure and there is no best algorithm to solve all problems, two general-purpose adaptive algorithms have been designed for selecting the most appropriate algorithm, which can be chosen using a parameter that indicates the stiffness of the DMRE to be solved.},

Bayesian discriminating features (BDF) is a classifier which effectively utilizes this tool. In this classifier, any of the M largest eigenvalues of the training patterns' covariance matrix are individually involved in classification while the arithmetic average of the remaining eigenvalues take part just as a single parameter. In this paper, by suggesting a new classifier, effect of the number of involved eigenvalues in classification performance is studied. In the suggested classifier we ignore the arithmetic average that is utilized in BDF. Our experiments verify that increasing M does not lead to an ongoing increase in classifier's detection rate in both BDF and the proposed one. However, by over-increasing M, the dependency of classifiers' parameters to the training samples increases which could reduce the performance of the classifiers when they come to make decision about new samples. Furthermore, experimental results verify that arithmetic average of the remaining eigenvalues in BDF improves the classifier performance only when an appropriate number of eigenvalues is selected; hence, ignoring the arithmetic average, as done in proposed classifier, could provide a better performance rather than BDF. &copy; 2011 IEEE.},

Now, these methods are used to derive some BDF-Runge-Kutta type formulas (of second-, third- and fourth-order), capable of the exact integration (with only round-off errors) of differential equations whose solutions are linear combinations of an exponential with parameter A and ordinary polynomials. Theorems of the truncation error reveal the good behavior of the new methods for stiff problems. Plots of their absolute stability regions that include the whole of the negative real axis are provided. Different procedures to find the parameter of the method are proposed, using these techniques there will not be necessary to compute the exponential matrix at each step, even when nonlinear problems are integrated. Numerical examples underscore the efficiency of the proposed codes, especially when they are integrating stiff problems. &copy; 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract  = {Many scientific and engineering problems are described using Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), where the analytic solution is unknown. Much research has been done by the scientific community on developing numerical methods which can provide an approximate solution of the original ODE. In this work, two approaches have been considered based on BDF and Piecewise-linearized Methods. The approach based on BDF methods uses a Chord-Shamanskii iteration for computing the nonlinear system which is obtained when the BDF schema is used. Two approaches based on piecewise-linearized methods have also been considered. These approaches are based on a theorem proved in this paper which allows to compute the approximate solution at each time step by means of a block-oriented method based on diagonal Pade&acute; approximations. The difference between these implementations is in using or not using the scale and squaring technique. Five algorithms based on these approaches have been developed. MATLAB and Fortran versions of the above algorithms have been developed, comparing both precision and computational costs. BLAS and LAPACK libraries have been used in Fortran implementations. In order to compare in equality of conditions all implementations, algorithms with fixed step have been considered. Four of the five case studies analyzed come from biology and chemical kinetics stiff problems. Experimental results show the advantages of the proposed algorithms, especially when they are integrating stiff problems. &copy; 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract  = {Differential Riccati equations play a fundamental role in control theory, for example, optimal control, filtering and estimation, decoupling and order reduction, etc. The most popular codes to solve stiff differential Riccati equations use backward differentiation formula (BDF) methods. In this paper, a new approach to solve differential Riccati equations by means of a BDF method is described. In each step of these methods an algebraic Riccati equation is obtained, which is solved by means of Newton's method. In the standard approach, this system is transformed into a Sylvester equation, which could be solved by means of the well-known Bartels-Stewart method. In our code, we obtain a system of linear equations, defined from a Kronecker product of matrices related to coefficient matrices of the differential Riccati equation, that is solved by means of the iterative generalized minimum residual (GMRES) method. We have also implemented an efficient matrix-vector product in order to reduce the computational and storage cost of the GMRES method. The above approach has been applied in the development of an algorithm to solve differential Riccati equations. The accuracy and efficiency of this algorithm has been compared with the BDF algorithm that uses the Bartels-Stewart method. Experimental results show the advantages of the new algorithm. &copy; 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The hysteresis model is not dependent on an integration step, thus it can be incorporated in a state-space form of a stiff differential equations system. The developed algorithm is based on a L-stable backward differentiation formulas-BDF numerical method. This method suppresses numerical oscillations in transient calculations. In addition, the algorithm, when used, eliminates the negative effect of "overshooting". Several simple test cases are demonstrated to show improvements and its suitability for simulation of low-frequency transformer transients such as inrush currents and ferroresonance. The realized hysteresis model can be incorporated in the EMTP-ATP by using the simplest combination of existing trapezoidal and proposed BDF method of order 1, known as theta method.},

The only difference is that the former obtains a numerical solution at the middle point of the time interval, while the latter has a solution at the end of the interval. A new composite method is established through applying these two algorithms alternately, which combines the advantages of the numerical dissipation property of the third order algorithm and the high-order accuracy of the fourth order algorithm. The usage frequency of the two algorithms during the whole step-by-step integration procedure is an important parameter affecting the numerical dissipation, which is investigated in this study. As the algebraic equations systems solved by the two algorithms are exactly same, no extra computation effort is introduced.},

It is also shown that the behavior of the proposed method in analysis of finite element system is effective and reliable. To show the robustness and features of proposed method, a challenging problem with a very stiff and flexible response, a Howe truss under impact load, a frame under harmonic loading and a rectangular domain in plane strain condition are considered, and derived results are compared with references solutions and other results reported in the literature.},

Therefore, stress wave have a significant effect on the life of composite structures. In this study, a four sub-step explicit time integration scheme is proposed for solving stress wave propagation problems. This method builds on the fourth-order central difference method and a high-order derivative term to minimize the numerical oscillation. The proposed scheme possesses a first-order accuracy in the case of undamped and damped systems. Stability, accuracy, and dispersion of the proposed explicit direct time integration scheme are analyzed. Furthermore, the performance of this scheme is illustrated by the solution of a stress wave propagation and wave reflection in a one-dimensional impact problem and two-dimensional scalar wave propagation.},

An integral over an infinite interval may have to be transformed into an integral over an infinite interval first. A definite integral can be approximated numerically as the weighted average over a finite number of function values. Specific sets of quadrature points and quadrature weights are known as “integral rules”. Newton-Cotes rules use equidistant points and are easy to apply. Accuracy can be improved by dividing the integration range into sub-intervals and applying composite Newton-Cotes rules. Extrapolation methods reduce the error almost to machine precision but need many function evaluations. Equidistant sample points are convenient but not the best choice. Clenshaw-Curtis expressions use non uniform sample points and a rapidly converging Chebyshev expansion. Gaussian integration fully optimizes the sample points with the help of orthogonal polynomials.},

This expansion of the global discretization error exists in spite of the fact that the solution u*usually has jump discontinuities in its derivatives at the points t = nτ, n ∈ N. Thus repeated extrapolation to the limit (Richardson extrapolation) may be applied to improve the approximation.

The essays were conducted in Guanh茫es, Minas Gerais, in a complete randomized block design in five replications, row plots of six E. urophylla and eight E. grandis plants in 3.0 x 2.0 m spacing. The genetic parameters were estimated by mixed models using the REML / BLUP (restricted maximum likelihood / best linear unbiased prediction) procedure for diameter at breast height (DBH), total height (TH) and individual volume (VOL) traits. The genetic values were only predicted for diameter at breast height (DBH), to which the selection was performed. The estimated heritability values in the restricted sense for Eucalyptus urophylla were 0.2785 and for accuracy 61%, and 0.2247 and 53% in Eucalyptus grandis, respectively. Selection of 100 parents of each species individually will provide genetic gains of 20.6 % in Eucalyptus urophylla and of 16.4 % in Eucalyptus grandis. A genetic gain for diameter at breast height around 35.0% can be obtained by crosses among the first 10 selected individuals of each species and carriers of the greatest genetic divergences.},

The following methods are considered: implicit Euler, implicit midpoint, and trapezoidal rules. In strongly stiff situations ($\varepsilon $ significantly smaller than the stepsize h) the implicit Euler scheme admits a full asymptotic expansion; the same is true for the midpoint rule and for the trapezoidal rule under certain coupling conditions. In those strongly stiff cases where a full expansion does not exist for the midpoint or trapezoidal rule, the remainder term is of a reduced order but shows a regular, oscillating behavior that is described in detail. In mildly stiff situations, order reductions of the remainder term inevitably occur in any case after the start or after the change of st...},

In this way, liquids have been deionised so effectively that their resistivities have been increased by three orders of magnitude as compared with previously published values. Published work on this subject is summarised. Removal of trace impurities from liquids may help to clarify mechanisms of electrical conduction, charge injection, and charge exchange phenomena in polar liquids.

The current paper presents a scheme where this method is developed to an efficient implicit unconditionally stable time integration method. In this research, in order to apply the stabilization process, first, a series of implicit standard formulas were derived from previous explicit formulation. Then after inserting two controlling parameters $\gamma$ and $\beta$ in the standard formulas, unconditional stability is guaranteed. The values of these two parameters have been determined to not only maintain the stability but also ensure the desired accuracy. Finally, for the new method, a simple step-by-step algorithm is presented. Stability and accuracy analysis of the proposed algorithm has been completely investigated. The efficiency and computational cost of the proposed method are demonstrated through two numerical simulations. Compared with those from some of the existing numerical methods in the literature, such as the Bathe method, the proposed method has higher computation efficiency with less time consumption.},

Another important property identified is that in uniform spatial discretizations for the problems solved, the calculated solution accuracy is almost independent of the solution direction considered. Numerical solutions of some wave propagation problems are given to demonstrate these attributes and show that with the schemes discussed very accurate response predictions can be obtained.},

The solutions of three increasingly complex three-dimensional problems are studied (1) to establish the reliability of the method for practical linear elasticity problems and (2) to assess the effectiveness of the method as compared to the standard finite element method. The solutions indicate that the method of finite spheres is between one and two orders of magnitude more expensive in computational time than the standard finite element method.

The standard finite element shape functions are used with interpolation cover functions over patches of elements to increase the convergence of the finite element scheme. The cover functions not only capture higher gradients of a field variable but also smooth out inter-element stress jumps. Since the order of the interpolations in the covers can vary, the method provides flexibility to use different covers for different patches and increases the solution accuracy without any local mesh refinement. As pointed out, the procedure can be derived from various general theoretical approaches and the basic theory has been presented earlier. We evaluate the effectiveness of the method, and illustrate the power of the scheme through the solution of various problems. The method also has potential for the development of error measures.

  abstract  = {姝he capability to automatically solve boundary value problems on complex domains has led to the widespread use of the finite element techniques. However, problems associated with the generation of a "good quality" mesh has resulted in the development of so-called 'meshfree methods', which offer an alterative to the finite element methods by circumventing the problem of mesh generation. Several of these techniques have been reviewed in reference [1]. The method of finite spheres (MFS) [1] is a truly mesh free method in which the computational domain is discretized using spheres. The partition of unity paradigm is used to generate the approximation functions and specialized numerical integration schemes have been developed to efficiently compute the terms in the Galerkin weak form [2].},

  abstract  = {The objective of this thesis is to present a finite element method and the method of finite spheres enriched for the solution of various wave propagation problems. The first part of this thesis is to present an enriched finite element method which is an extension of the procedure introduced by Kohno, Bathe, and Wright for one dimensional problems. Specifically, the novelties are: two-dimensional problems are solved (and three-dimensional problems would be tackled similarly), a scheme is given to overcome ill-conditioning, the method is presented for time-dependent problems, and focus is on the solution of problems in solids and structures using real arithmetic only. The method combines advantages of finite element and spectral techniques, but an important point is that it preserves the fundamental properties of the finite element method. The second part of this thesis focuses on developing the method of finite spheres for the analysis of wave propagations. This method is a truly meshless technique developed for the solution of boundary value problems on geometrically complex domains. In the new development trigonometric functions are used to interpolate the solution of wave propagations. An effective numerical integration rule resulting in a significant reduction in computational cost is presented. Several numerical examples are provided demonstrating the effectiveness of the scheme.},

The optimal solution is then to have both implicit algorithm and explicit methods readily available in the same code and to be able to switch automatically from one to another. Criteria that decide when to shift from a method to another have been developed here. Implicit balanced restarting conditions that annihilate numerical oscillations resulting for an explicit calculation are also proposed.},

Therefore, the values obtained after an explicit computation cannot be used directly as initial conditions for an implicit simulation.

  abstract  = {{Simulating the nonlinear behavior of complex systems requires
   significant computational effort. Despite the rapid progress in
   computing technology, the demand is still strong for more efficient
   simulation methods in diverse structural dynamics fields such as
   nonlinear system identification and nonlinear system reliability. In
   addition to efficiency, algorithmic stability and accuracy must be
   addressed in the development of new simulation procedures. In this
   paper, a method to treat localized nonlinearities in a structure
   efficiently and accurately is proposed. The method is conditionally
   stable. The system equations are separated into a state-invariant linear
   part and a state-dependent nonlinear part that is considered to be
   external pseudo-forces that act on the linear system. The response of
   the system is obtained by fixed point iterations in which the
   pseudo-forces are updated until convergence. In addition to the one
   time-step-ahead prediction form, the novel idea of multiple
   time-step-ahead prediction is proposed. The effect of this approach is
   investigated and shown to increase algorithm efficiency and stability.
   To perform the numerical integration, time-stepping schemes like the
   exponential first-order hold method can be used to the advantage of
   efficiency and accuracy. To increase the accuracy and stability of the
   method, a novel second-order hold equivalent is derived and implemented.
   The efficiency, stability, and accuracy of the method are demonstrated
   in numerical examples. Finally, the method is applied to the
   earthquake-induced motion of a 20-story building with local
   nonlinearities. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Then, the transfer function and characteristic equation of the algorithms with integration coefficients are obtained by the Z transformation. Furthermore, their integration coefficients are derived according to the poles condition. It was indicated that the proposed algorithms possess the advantages of second-order accuracy, self-starting, and unconditional stability for linear systems and nonlinear systems with softening stiffness. The numerical dissipation of the algorithms is controlled by the spectral radius at infinity ρ∞. It was also shown that the proposed algorithms have the same poles as the Yu-α algorithm, and thus the same ...},

The influence of Newmark parameters and substep sizes on conservation of energy and momentum is studied through a numerical example. It is found that the numerical dissipation increases as the Newmark parameters are changed. Also, as the substep size corresponding to Newmark scheme increases the numerical dissipation increases.

  abstract  = {For a fairly general class of second order accurate algorithms, a sub-stepping procedure is described which achieves fourth order accuracy while retaining the stability, conservation properties and implementation of the underlying second order method. Two features render the proposed approach especially attractive from a computational perspective over conventional fourth order methods. First, the improved (fourth order) accuracy is attained merely by two additional residual evaluations, with no changes in the implementation of the underlying second order method. In particular, no additional storage or extra computations of high order gradients are required. Second, for Hamiltonian systems, the stability properties and possible conservation properties of the underlying second order method, such as energy, momentum and symplectic character, are preserved. The new technique is applied to a number of standard algorithms for elastodynamics, structural and rigid body dynamics. In particular, when applied to the recently proposed (second order accurate) energy-momentum method, this approach results in a fourth order accurate energy, linear and angular momentum conserving algorithm for general Hamiltonian systems.},

Attention is focused on providing a brief overview and an indepth evaluation of the developments, methodology, computational issues and implementation aspects for practical problems. Different from the way we have been looking at the developments encompassing existing direct time-integration type methods and mode superposition techniques, the proposed methodology capitalizes on the computational attributes of both and thereby offers new perspectives and several attractive favourable features in terms of stability and accuracy, storage, and computational costs for a wide variety of inertial dynamic problems. Recently, the authors have shown the theoretical developments via the VIP methodology for transient structural problems and for transient thermal problems. The purpose of the present paper is to summarize the theoretical developments, improve upon the computational/implementation aspects for general linear/non-linear dynamic structural problems, and demonstrate the pros and cons via numerous illustrative test cases. The theoretical analysis and results of several test cases show that the VIP methodology has improved accuracy/stability characteristics and computational advantages in comparison to the commonly advocated explicit and implicit methods such as the Newmark family. Overall, an analysis of the theoretical developments, algorithmic study, and the implementation and evaluation of the formulations strongly suggest the proposition that the VIP methodology is a viable alternative for general structural dynamic applications encountered in practical engineering problems.},

The Green functions are implicitly calculated in the frequency-domain. The accuracy is significantly improved when compared with traditional direct integration methods, or with other methods based on the Green approach. This method is able to deal with non-linear behaviour and implicity consider the frequency dependence of added mass and potential damping, encountered in offshore systems problems.},

By means of the weighted residual method in both time and space, the time integral expression concerning the ExGA is readily established. The arising ExGA time integral expression is spatially discretized in a finite element sense and a recursive scheme that employs time-domain numerical Green’s function matrices is adopted to evaluate the displacement and the velocity vectors. These Green’s matrices are computed by the time discontinuous Galerkin finite element method only at the first time step. The system of coupled equations originated from the time discontinuous Galerkin method is then solved by an iterative predictor–multicorrector algorithm. Once the Green’s matrices are computed, no iterative process is required to obtain the displacement and the velocity vectors at any time level. At the end of the paper, numerical examples are presented in order to compare the proposed approach with other approaches.},

  year      = {2015},
  abstract  = {Green's function based methodologies for elastodynamics in both time and frequency domains, which can be either numerical or analytical, appear in many branches of physics and engineering. Thus, the development of exact expressions for Green's functions is of great importance. Unfortunately, such expressions are known only for relatively few kinds of geometry, medium and boundary conditions. In this way, due to the difficulty in finding exact Green's functions, specially in the time domain, the present paper presents a solution of the transient elastodynamic equations by a time-stepping technique based on the Explicit Green's Approach method written in terms of the Green's and Step response functions, both being computed numerically by the finite element method. The major feature is the computation of these functions separately by the central difference time integration scheme and locally owing to the principle of causality. More precisely, Green's functions are computed only at t = 螖t adopting two time substeps while Step response functions are computed directly without substeps. The proposed time-stepping method shows to be quite accurate with distinct numerical properties not presented in the standard central difference scheme as addressed in the numerical example.},

Their computations are carried out independently by means of the semidiscrete FEM and the Central difference method. Due to the principle of causality, the Green’s and Step response functions admit a compact support surround the source points for a small enough time step that is usually employed in common explicit time integration methods applied to wave propagation modeling. In this sense, the Green’s and Step response functions at t=Δt can be efficiently computed locally through small subdomains. Each local subdomain with its respective submesh covers only nodes whose Green’s and Step response function values do not vanish. The accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed methodology are demonstrated by analyzing three numerical examples.},

  abstract  = {In this work, coupled numerical analysis of interacting acoustic and dynamic models is focused. In this context, several numerical methods, such as the finite difference method, the finite element method, the boundary element method, meshless methods, and so forth, are considered to model each subdomain of the coupled model, and multidomain decomposition techniques are applied to deal with the coupling relations. Two basic coupling algorithms are discussed here, namely the explicit direct coupling approach and the implicit iterative coupling approach, which are formulated based on explicit/implicit time-marching techniques. Completely independent spatial and temporal discretizations among the interacting subdomains are permitted, allowing optimal discretization for each sub-domain of the model to be considered. At the end of the paper, numerical results are presented, illustrating the performance and potentialities of the discussed methodologies.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Time integration of ODEs or time-dependent PDEs with required resolution of the fastest time scales of the system, can be very costly if the system exhibits multiple time scales of different magnitudes. If the different time scales are localised to different components, corresponding to localisation in space for a PDE, efficient time integration thus requires that we use different time steps for different components. We present an overview of the multi-adaptive Galerkin methods mcG(q) and mdG(q) recently introduced in a series of papers by the author. In these methods, the time step sequence is selected individually and adaptively for each component, based on an a posteriori error estimate of the global error. The multi-adaptive methods require the solution of large systems of nonlinear algebraic equations which are solved using explicit-type iterative solvers (fixed point iteration). If the system is stiff, these iterations may fail to converge, corresponding to the well-known fact that standard explicit methods are inefficient for stiff systems. To resolve this problem, we present an adaptive strategy for explicit time integration of stiff ODEs, in which the explicit method is adaptively stabilised by a small number of small, stabilising time steps.},

  abstract       = { The primary purpose of this paper is to develop novel fast dynamic methods for large-scale problems of structural dynamics at the least computational efforts. The explicit method of double time steps (EMDTS) is proposed through integration with the assumption of linear acceleration in two time steps. The corrected explicit method of double time steps (CEMDTS) is obtained after correcting the EMDTS. The analyses of stability, accuracy, numerical dissipation and dispersion are performed on the proposed methods. Finally, both linear and nonlinear numerical examples are utilised for the comparison of the two new methods and the established methods. The results show that the EMDTS is unstable in undamped linear systems; however, the CEMDTS has a nondissipative property and the same stability condition as the explicit central difference method (ECDM). The amplitude error of the EMDTS is greater than that of the CEMDTS and the ECDM when the time step is large. The CEMDTS possesses excellent comprehensive properties with less damping ratio error and periodic error than the ECDM in the case of small time steps at almost the same computational efforts. Three numerical examples manifest that the CEMDTS is better than the EMDTS, and endowed with good accuracy and stable properties. },

We review an implicit time integration method, the Bathe method, that remains stable without the use of adjustable parameters when the commonly used trapezoidal rule results in unstable solutions. We then focus on additional important attributes of the scheme. We present dispersion properties of the Bathe method and show that its desired characteristics for structural dynamics are also valuable for wave propagation problems. A dispersion analysis using the CFL number is given and the solution of some benchmark problems show that the scheme is a method for general use for structural dynamics and wave propagations. Finally, we propose a new explicit time integration method for the analysis of wave propagation problems. The scheme has been formulated using a sub-step within a time step to achieve desired numerical damping to suppress undesirable spurious oscillations of high frequencies. With the optimal CFL number, the method uses about 10% more solution effort as the standard central difference scheme but significantly improves the solution accuracy and a non-diagonal damping matrix can directly be included. The stability, accuracy and numerical dispersion are analyzed, and solutions to problems are given that illustrate the performance of the scheme.

This is a brand new type of amplitude growth and it has never been found in the conventional integration methods. The root cause of this unusual amplitude growth can be revealed by examining the local truncation error constructed from a forced vibration error, where the dominant error term for high frequency modes plays the key role for this unusual amplitude growth. An effective remedy is proposed by introducing a load-dependent term into the difference equation for displacement and/or velocity increment to remove the dominant error term. As a result, this adverse amplitude growth can be automatically removed. Consequently, the inclusion of the load-dependent term in the formulation of the difference equation for displacement increment and/or velocity increment is inevitable for a general structure-dependent integration method. },

In particular, mixed implicit-explicit formulations employing the alpha method proposed by Hughes et al. (1987, 1990) are described for the numerical simulation of hyperbolic heat conduction models, which involves time-dependent relaxation effects. Existing analytical approaches for modeling/analysis of such models involve complex mathematical formulations for obtaining closed-form solutions, while in certain numerical formulations the difficulties include severe oscillatory solution behavior (which often disguises the true response) in the vicinity of the thermal disturbances, which propagate with finite velocities. In view of these factors, the alpha method is evaluated to assess the control of the amount of numerical dissipation for predicting the transient propagating thermal disturbances. Numerical test models are presented, and pertinent conclusions are drawn for the mixed-time integration simulation of hyperbolic heat conduction models involving non-Fourier effects.},

  abstract  = {Conventional approaches for computational structural dynamics (CSD) relevant to time-integration methods involve first employing the classical Galerkin formulations for the spatial discretization to yield a set of ordinary differential equations in time and then employing finite difference approximations for deriving the appropriate step-by-step algorithms. And, almost all of the widely advocated (existing) step-by-step schemes for structural dynamics require an initial acceleration vector to be specified (evaluated) in addition to displacement and velocity vectors for starting the schemes. Unlike the above, in this paper we introduce new representations and architecture towards providing not only direct self-starting features with the elimination of acceleration computations but also for enhancing the computational architecture itself via several other inherent distinguishing characteristics. Thereby, a robust and effective methodology of computation is presented which is an extension of our previous efforts (see Tamma and Namburu3). In particular, to illustrate the basic concepts, in this paper we focus attention on the development of explicit time-integration formulations. The methodology involves expressing the governing dynamic equations of motion in conservation form, and firstly temporal discretization is accomplished in the spirit of Lax-Wendroff-type formulations. Therein, discretization in space is accomplished by introducing stress-based representations and employing the classical Galerkin scheme, and, quite naturally, we advocate employing finite elements as the principal computational tool because of its several inherent advantages. The stability and accuracy of the proposed formulations and the several added distinguishing features are briefly highlighted. Considerations on the effects of damping are additionally included and the introduction of general boundary conditions in a natural setting permits an effective generalized architecture for general applications. Numerical test models are presented to validate the overall developments for computational structural dynamics.},

  abstract  = {Within the total energy framework which we introduce here for the first time (in contrast to Lagrangian or Hamiltonian mechanics framework), we provide an alternative and have developed in this paper a general numerical discretization for continuum-elastodynamics directly stemming from Hamilton’s law of varying action (HLVA) involving a measurable built-in scalar function, namely, Total Energy \({[{\mathcal{E}}\left({{\boldsymbol{q}},\dot{{\boldsymbol{q}}}}\right): TQ\rightarrow {\mathbb{R}}]}\) . The Total Energy we use herein for enabling the space discretization is defined as the kinetic energy plus the potential energy for N-body systems, and the kinetic energy plus the total potential energy for continuum-body systems. It thereby provides a direct measure and sound physical interpretation naturally, while enabling this framework to permit general numerical discretizations such as with finite elements. In the variational formulation proposed here, we place particular emphasis upon the notion that the scalar function which represents the autonomous total energy of the continuum/N-body dynamical systems can be a crucial mathematical function and physical quantity which is a constant of motion in conservative systems. In addition, we prove that the autonomous total energy possesses the three invariant properties and can be viewed as the so-called total energy version of Noether’s theorem; therefore, the autonomous total energy has time/translational/rotational symmetries for the continuum/N-body dynamical systems. The proposed concepts directly emanating from HLVA inherently involving the scalar function, namely, total energy: (i) can be shown to yield the same governing mathematical model equations of motion that are continuous in space and time together with the natural boundary conditions just as Hamilton’s principle (HP) is routinely used to derive such equations, but without obvious inconsistency via such a principle as explained in the paper; (ii) explain naturally the Bubnov–Galerkin weighted-residual form that is customarily employed for discretization for both space and time, and alternately, (iii) circumvent relying on traditional practices of conducting numerical discretizations starting either from the balance of linear momentum (Newton’s second law) involving Cauchy’s equations of motion (governing equations) arising from continuum mechanics or via (i) and (ii) above if one chooses this option, and instead provides new avenues of discretization for continuum-dynamical systems. The present developments naturally embody the weak form in space and time that can be described by a discrete Total Energy Differential Operator (TEDO). Thereby, a novel yet simple, space-discrete Total Energy formulation proposed here only needs to employ the discrete TEDO which provides new avenues and directly yields the semi-discrete ordinary differential equations in time which can be readily shown to preserve the same physical attributes as the continuous systems for continuum-dynamical applications unlike traditional practices. The modeling of complicated structural dynamical systems such as Euler-Bernoulli beams and Reissner–Mindlin plates is particularly shown here for illustration.},

  abstract  = {Of general interest here is the time dimension aspect wherein discretized operators in time may be continuous or discontinuous; and of particular interest and focus here is the design of time discretized operators in the context of discontinuous state-phase for computational dynamics applications. Based on a generalized bi-discontinuous time weighted residual formulation, the design leading to a new unified set of hierarchical energy conserving and energy dissipating time discretized operators are developed for the first time that are fundamentally useful for time adaptive computations for dynamic problems. Unlike time discontinuous Galerkin approaches, the design is based upon a time discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin-like approach employing an asymptotic series type approximations for the state variables involving derivatives at the beginning of the time step. As a consequence, this enables to design methods that have spectral properties corresponding to the diagonal, first sub-diagonal and second sub-diagonal Pad\'{e} entries. Thus, \emph {A}-stable schemes of order$2q$, \emph {L}-stable schemes of order$2q-1$ and$2q-2$ are obtained. The spectral equivalent algorithms to the diagonal Pad\'{e} entry are energy conserving algorithms. The spectral equivalent algorithms to the first and second sub-diagonal Pad\'{e} entries are energy dissipating algorithms with the property of asymptotic annihilation of the high frequency response. Additionally, these time operators naturally inherit a hierarchical structure that are extremely useful for time adaptive computations. Moreover, since Pad\'{e} entries have the lowest relative error the developed schemes are optimal in terms of order of accuracy in time, dissipation, dispersion and zero-order displacement and velocity overshoot characteristics.},

A novel explicit primal-dual technique is proposed here to overcome the problems such as instabilities, order reduction in convergence and constraint preserving associated with the DAE index 3 system. Instead of simultaneously solving the generalized coordinates and the Lagrange multipliers, the differential equations and algebraic equations are specially treated thus solving the generalized coordinates separately from the Lagrange multipliers. The claims of the proposed technique are illustrated via numerical examples by employing explicit time integration operators in the conservation form.

To provide simplicity, high level of accuracy, and to retain the generality of the finite element implementation for both linear and non-linear transient explicit problems on a data parallel computer which permit optimum amount of communications, we implemented the present self-starting dynamic formulations (in comparison to the traditional approaches) based on nodal displacements, nodal velocities, and elemental stresses on the CM-5. Data parallel language CMFortran is employed with virtual processor constructs and with:SERIAL and:PARALLEL layout directives for arrays. The communications via the present approach involve only one gather operation (extraction of element nodal displacements or velocities from global displacement vector) and one scatter operation (dispersion of element forces onto global force vector) for each time step. These gather and scatter operations are implemented using the Connection Machine Scientific Software Library communication primitives for both structured and unstructured finite element meshes. The implementation aspects of the present self-starting formulations for linear and elastoplastic applications on serial and data parallel machines are discussed. Numerical test models for linear and non-linear one-dimensional applications and a two-dimensional unstructured finite element mesh are then illustrated and their performance studies are discussed.},

  abstract  = {ABSTRACT  The significance of particular computational algorithm by design within the context of a generalized single step single solve order preserving computational framework encompassing the class of LMS methods which directly deals with index 3 differential algebraic equations (DAE's) that naturally arise in multi-body dynamics systems with constraints is presented. For deriving the mathematical model for constraint dynamical systems such as multi-body dynamics, the the resulting governing equations naturally arise as index 3 DAE systems involving a position level constraint. there exist numerous computational difficulties with solving the index 3 systems and most existing techniques either loose their expected order of accuracy or fail to complete the analysis, and consequently index reduction methods are employed which in turn cause other problems such as drift in solutions. The present computational framework of a family of algorithms for index 3 DAE systems described here, have been derived from the GSSSS family of algorithms for linear dynamical non-constraint systems, based on the algorithmic time level consistency theorem. The algorithmic framework is capable of providing stable, robust, and accurate integration of index 3 DAE's directly for both rigid and rigid/flexible multi-body dynamics applications. A challenging numerical example is employed and numerical illustrations demonstrate the significance and importance of the presented technique, namely a novel midpoint rule formulation with midpoint based acceleration in resolving the numerical difficulties in contrast to the classical midpoint rule with endpoint acceleration and the classical Newmark method.},

The present computational framework and the underlying numerical methodology naturally inherit desirable features including second-order time accuracy, unconditional stability, and controllable numerical dissipation. Of noteworthy mention and significance is the fact that the framework, additionally, inherits new features that permit selective control of high-frequency damping for both the primary variable and its time derivative. Consequently, the development enables not only the analysis of long-term system dynamics to be satisfactory, but also readily enables one to capture the underlying physics. The current state of the art does not permit such features and consequently leads to physically incorrect dynamics of the system. Additionally, we describe in this article all the possible approaches that can be employed in the computational procedure to take into account the nonlinearity of the problem.

In this paper we focus on additional important attributes of the scheme, and specifically on showing that the procedure can also be effective in linear analyses.

  abstract  = {Summary Computational structural dynamics plays an essential role in the simulation of linear and nonlinear systems. Indeed, the characteristics of the time integration procedure have a critical impact on the feasibility of the calculation. In order to go beyond the classical approach (a unique time integrator and a unique timescale), the pioneer approach of Belytschko and co-workers consisted in developing mixed implicit鈥揺xplicit time integrators for structural dynamics. In a first step, the implementation and stability analyses of partitioned integrators with one time step have been achieved for a large class of time integrators. In a second step, the implementation and stability analyses of partitioned integrators with different time steps were studied in detail for particular cases. However, stability results involving different time steps and different time integrators in different parts of the mesh is still an open question in the general case for structural dynamics. The aim of this paper is to propose a state-of-the art of heterogeneous (different time schemes) asynchronous (different time steps) time integrators (HATI) for computational structural dynamics. Finally, an alternative approach based on energy considerations (with velocity continuity at the interface) is proposed in order to develop a general class of HATI for structural dynamics.

  abstract  = {A simple explicit–implicit finite element tearing and interconnecting (FETI) algorithm (AFETI-EI algorithm) is presented for partitioned transient analysis of linear structural systems. The present algorithm employs two decompositions. First, the total system is partitioned via spatial or domain decomposition to obtain the governing equations of motions for each partitioned domain. Second, for each partitioned subsystem, the governing equations are modally decomposed into the rigid-body and deformational equations. The resulting rigid-body equations are integrated by an explicit integrator, for its stability is not affected by step-size restriction on account of zero-frequency contents (ω  =  0). The modally decomposed partitioned deformation equations of motion are integrated by an unconditionally stable implicit integration algorithm. It is shown that the present AFETI-EI algorithm exhibits unconditional stability and that the resulting interface problem possesses the same solution matrix profile as the basic FETI static problems. The present simple dynamic algorithm, as expected, falls short of the performance of the FETI-DP but offers a similar performance of implicit two-level FETI-D algorithm with a much cheaper coarse solver; hence, its simplicity may offer relatively easy means for conducting parallel analysis of both static and dynamic problems by employing the same basic scalable FETI solver, especially for research-mode numerical experiments.

First, we demonstrate analytically that the classical Newmark family as well as related integration algorithms are variational in the sense of the Veselov formulation of discrete mechanics. Such variational algorithms are well known to be symplectic and momentum preserving and to often have excellent global energy behaviour. This analytical result is verified through numerical examples and is believed to be one of the primary reasons that this class of algorithms performs so well. Second, we develop algorithms for mechanical systems with forcing, and in particular, for dissipative systems. In this case, we develop integrators that are based on a discretization of the Lagrange d'Alembert principle as well as on a variational formulation of dissipation. It is demonstrated that these types of structured integrators have good numerical behaviour in terms of obtaining the correct amounts by which the energy changes over the integration run.

This strategy can either be based on a continuous or discontinuous approximation of the physical variables in time. All formulations were analyzed, and their characteristics in terms of truncation error (phase and amplitude) and stability are presented. This analysis was verified by numerical results.

The nonlinear dynamic equations of motion, in their explicit form, appear quite complex due to the expression for the absolute accelerations.In this paper weak formulations of linear and angular momentum balance laws of a rigid body undergoing large overall motion are stated a priori. Holonomic as well nonholonomic constraints, that may exist on the motion of the rigid body, are introduced into this weak form in a fundamentally novel fashion here. Comments are made on the incremental form (and consistent linearization) of the weak formulation (with constraints), and the time-finite-element solutions thereof.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents general variational formulations for dynamical problems, which are easily implemented numerically. The development presents the relationship between the very general weak formulation arising from linear and angular momentum balance considerations, and well known variational priciples. Two and three field mixed forms are developed from the general weak form. The variational principles governing large rotational motions are linearized and implemented in a time finite element framework, with appropriate expressions for the relevant “tangent” operators being derived. In order to demonstrate the validity of the various formulations, the special case of free rigid body motion is considered. The primal formulation is shown to have unstable numerical behavior, while the mixed formulation exhibits physically stable behavior. The formulations presented in this paper form the basis for continuing investigations into constrained dynamical systems and multi-rigid-body systems, which will be reported in subsequent papers.},

  abstract  = {Weak formulations in Analytical Dynamics are developed, paralleling the variational methods in elastostatics, and including a fundamental yet novel approach for treating constraints (both holonomic and nonholonomic). A general three-field approach is presented, in which the momentum balance conditions, the compatibility conditions between displacement and velocity, the constitutive relations and the displacement and momentum boundary conditions are all enforced in weak form. A primal, or kinematic formulation is developed from the general form by enforcing the compatibility conditions and displacement boundary conditions a priori . The conditional stability of the kinematic formulation is the counterpart of the locking phenomenon in elastostatics and may be avoided, either by reduced order integration, or by utilizing a mixed formulation. Toward this end, a two-field mixed formulation is presented, which follows from the general form, when the constitutive relations are satisfied a priori . A general set of the constraint equations is introduced into the kinematic and mixed formulations, using a specific choice of multipliers, which results in modified variational principles. Several simple examples concerning rigid body dynamics are presented.},

  abstract  = {Constraint equations arise in the dynamics of mechanical systems whenever there is the need to restrict kinematically possible motions of the system. In practical applications, constraint equations can be used to simulate complex, connected systems. If the simulation must be carried out numerically, it is useful to look for a formulation that leads straightforwardly to a numerical approximation.  In this paper, we extend the methodology of our previous work to incorporate the dynamics of holonomically and nonholonomically constrained systems. The constraint equations are cast in a variatonal form, which may be included easily, in the time finite element framework. The development of the weak constraint equations and their associated “tangent” operators is presented. We also show that this approach to constraint equations may be employed to develop time finite elements using a quaternion parametrization of finite rotation. Familiarity with the notation and methodology of our previously presented work is assumed.},

In order to achieve these properties we replace the original potential energy by a piecewise constant, or terraced approximation at steps of uniform height. By taking steps of diminishing height, an approximating sequence of energies is generated. The trajectories of the resulting approximating Lagrangians can be characterized explicitly and consist of intervals of piecewise rectilinear motion. We show that the energy-stepping trajectories are symplectic, exactly conserve all the momentum maps of the original system and, subject to a transversality condition, converge to trajectories of the original system when the energy step is decreased to zero. These properties, the excellent long-term behavior of energy-stepping and its automatic time-step selection property, are born out by selected examples of application, including the dynamics of a frozen Argon cluster, the spinning of an elastic cube and the collision of two elastic spheres.

In addition to a discussion of the difficulties and their elimination and the presentation of a workable formulation for initial value problems, the utility of finite elements in the time domain is demonstrated by means of two examples: (1) a linear oscillator subjected to discontinuous forces, and (2) the response of a beam to a moving mass.},

Second, in its variational form, it offers physical insight into the so-called “trailing terms” of Hamilton's law. Third, numerical applications (i.e., finite elements in time) can be proven to be convergent under correct application of the bilinear formulation, whereas they can be demonstrated to diverge for specific problems under Hamilton's law. Fourth, the bilinear formulation offers automatic convergence of the “natural” velocity end conditions; while these must be constrained in present applications of Hamilton's law. Fifth, the bilinear formulation can be implemented in terms of a Larange multiplier that gives an order of magnitude improvement in the convergence of velocity.

  abstract  = {Abstract When a cubic function is interpolated between the prescribed initial displacement and velocity and the exact displacement and velocity at the end of a time step for a single degree of freedom system, the error, or residual, in the governing equation is zero at a number of times. It is shown that for a general undamped system, in the limit as the time step approaches zero these times correspond to Gauss points. This observation is verified by considering a general collocation procedure in which the displacement in any time step is approximated as a cubic function of time, with two coefficients chosen to satisfy the displacement and velocity at the beginning of the time step with the other two coefficients being chosen to satisfy the governing differential equation at any two times. It is shown that optimum accuracy is obtained if these points are the Gauss points. Detailed expressions are then presented for this particular case, and stability of the algorithm is investigated showing that the procedure is conditionally stable. For time steps which are a small proportion of the least period of vibration of the structure, the algorithm is considered to be the most accurate possible procedure based on cubic approximation of the displacement.},

A general framework is proposed in the following pages, where the configuration space and the phase space forms of Hamilton's Law provide the general statements of the problem of motion. Within this framework, different families of integration algorithms are derived, according to different interpretations of the boundary terms. The bi-discontinuous form is obtained as the consequence of a consistent impulsive formulation of dynamics, while the discontinuous Galerkin form is obtained when the boundary terms at the end of the time interval are appropriately approximated.},

By post-processing the Newmark solutions, we derive a simple formulation for linearly varied third-order derivatives. By comparing the Newmark solutions with the exact solutions expanded in the Taylor series, we achieve the local post-processed solutions which are of fifth-order accuracy for displacements and fourth-order accuracy for velocities in one step. Based on the post-processing technique, a posteriori local error estimates for displacements, velocities and, thus, also the total energy norm error estimate are obtained. If the Newmark solutions are corrected at each step, the post-processed solutions are of third-order accuracy in the global sense, i.e. one-order improvement for the original Newmark solutions is achieved. We also discuss a method for estimating the global time integration error. We find that, when the total energy norm is used, the sum of the local error estimates will give a reasonable estimate for the global error. We present numerical studies on a SDOF and a 2-DOF example in order to demonstrate the performance of the proposed technique.},

In this manner A -stable schemes of order 2k and L-stable schemes of order 2k - l are obtained, at least for k ⩽ 4. The methods are hierarchical in the sense that a scheme with a given accuracy embraces the equations of all lower-order methods that have the same stability type.

   equations based on the weighted residual method are presented. Instead
   of specifying the weighting functions, the weighting parameters are used
   to control the algorithm characteristics. If the numerical solution is
   approximated by a polynomial of degree n, the approximation is at least
   nth-order accurate. By choosing the weighting parameters carefully, the
   order of accuracy can be improved. The generalized Pade approximations
   with polynomials of degree n as the numerator and denominator are
   considered. The weighting parameters are chosen to reproduce the
   generalized Pade approximations. Once the weighting parameters are
   known, any set of linearly independent basic functions can be used to
   construct the corresponding weighting functions. The stabilizing
   weighting factions for the weighted residual method are then found
   explicitly. The accuracy of the particular solution due to excitation is
   also considered. It is shown that additional weighting parameters may be
   required to maintain the overall accuracy. The corresponding equations
   are listed and the additional weighting parameters are solved
   explicitly. However, it is found that some weighting functions could
   satisfy the listed equations automatically. Copyright (C) 1999 John

It seems that this is the reason for the appearance in the scientific literature of arguments about the fitness of Hamilton's principle, and more generally Hamilton's law, for direct calculations of dynamic systems. However, it is shown in this paper that there exist six correct formulations of Hamilton's law for each degree of freedom of the dynamic system. These formulations also include Hamilton's principle. The use of all of the 6**n correct formulations yields correct results. The paper centers around 6**n correct formulations of Hamilton's law.},

The author considers discretization systems which preserve the characteristic properties and inner symmetries of the original continuous systems. The centered Euler scheme, its generalizations, and staggered explicit schemes for separable Hamiltonians appear to have the property that the transition from one time step to the next time step is canonical, and the invariant integrals of the original system remain invariant under this transition. Next, the author considers generating functions and the problem of the construction of canonical difference schemes on the basis of these functions. As an illustration he constructs a family of canonical difference schemes of arbitrary order from the truncations of the Taylor series of the generating functions.},

Nevertheless, the mechanisms leading to their generation are not elucidated. We performed microarray analysis to identify genes involved in EMP release by the endothelial cell line HMEC-1 in response to thrombin. We identified a group of genes linked to the cytoskeleton reorganization family. Among these, the Rho-kinase ROCK-II presented a high transcription rate. ROCK-I, another Rho-kinase isoform, was not modulated by thrombin. Pharmacologic inhibition of Rho-kinases or specific depletion of ROCK-II by short interfering (si) RNA inhibited thrombin-induced EMP release. In contrast, ROCK-I mRNA silencing did not modify EMP generation by thrombin. Exposure of HMEC-1 to thrombin in presence of the caspase-2 selective inhibitor Z-VDVAD-FMK prevented ROCK-II cleavage and inhibited the thrombin-induced EMP release. These events were observed in absence of cell death. Our data clearly identified ROCK-II as a target of thrombin in EMP generation. They indicated that the 2 Rho-kinases did not share identical functions. The involvement of caspase-2 in ROCK-II activation independently of cell death points out a novel signaling pathway that emphasizes the proteolytic activity of caspase in EMP generation in response to cell activation.},

Furthermore, under assumption met by all classical models, the internal dissipation in the system is non-negative. The goal of this work is the systematic design of conserving algorithms that preserve exactly the conservation laws of momentum and inherit the property of positive dissipation for any step-size. In particular, within the specific context of elastodynamics, a second order accurate algorithm is presented that exhibits exact conservation of both total (linear and angular) momentum and total energy. This scheme is shown to be amenable to a completely straightforward ( Galerkin) finite element implementation and ideally suited for long-term/large-scale simulations. The excellent performance of the method relative to conventional time-integrators is conclusively demonstrated in numerical simulations exhibiting large strains coupled with a large overall rigid motion.},

A notion of stability in energy is defined which guarantees that for small time steps energy is asymptotically conserved and for large time steps amplification of higher modes does not occur. By way of the energy identity, the average acceleration method is proved to be stable in that sense. Furthermore, convergence is proved and the rate-of-convergence is shown to be second-order, with respect to time step, for both displacements and velocities.},

The emphasis of this survey is on the methods and techniques used in software for solving ODEs.ODEs can be classified as stiff or nonstiff, and may be stiff for some parts of an interval and nonstiff for others. We discuss stiff equations, why they are difficult to solve, and methods and software for solving both nonstiff and stiff equations. We conclude this review by looking at techniques for dealing with special problems that may arise in some ODEs, for example, discontinuities.Although important theoretical developments have also taken place, we report only those developments which have directly affected the software and provide a review of this research. We present the basic concepts involved but assume that the reader has some background in numerical computing, such as a first course in numerical methods.},

We present conditions that ensure that the formula-pair is stable at zero and infinity and we demonstrate that the stability properties of a formula-pair can differ substantially from those of its component formulas. The order analysis provides necessary and sufficient conditions on the coefficients of a formula-pair to obtain a local truncation error of order p + 2.

This approach allows the errors produced by both discretization procedures to be counterbalanced, enabling more accurate analyses. A multi time-steps methodology is also considered here, associated to subcycling techniques, enhancing the efficiency and the adaptive features of the method. As it is described along the paper, the new technique is very effective, robust and simple to implement, providing a very suitable numerical approach to analyse complex wave propagation models. },

  abstract  = {The next generation of ODE software can be expected to detect special problems and to adapt to their needs. The low-cost, automatic detection of oscillatory behavior, the determination of its period, and methods for its subsequent efficient integration are addressed here, along with stiffness detection. In the first phase, the method for oscillatory problems discussed examines the output of any integrator to determine if the output is nearly periodic. At the point this answer is positive, the second phase is entered and an automatic, nonstiff, multirevolutionary method is invoked. This requires the occasional solution of a nearly periodic initial-value problem over one period by a standard method and the re-determination of its period. Because the multirevolutionary method uses a very large step, the problem has a high probability of being stiff in this second phase. Hence, it is important to detect if stiffness is present so that an appropriate stiff, multirevolutionary method can be selected. 6 figures.},

The algebraic stability properties of a number of particular methods in these families are studied and a generalization is made which enables estimates of error growth to be provided for certain classes of methods.},

A-stable LMMs are shown to be algebraically  stable GLMs for strictly positive definite G-matrices. Optimal order error bounds, independent of stiffness, are derived for A-stable methods, without considering one-leg  methods (OLMs). As a GLM, the OLM is shown to be the transpose of the LMM. For A-stable methods, the LMM G-matrix is the inverse of the OLM G-matrix. Examples of G-symplectic LMMs are given.},

By saving additional $m$ values it is possible to construct local polynomial approximations of degree $k + m - 1$, which can be used as predictor formulas. Different polynomial bases lead to different equivalent forms of multistep formulas. In particular, local monomial bases yield Nordsieck formulas. An explicit one-to-one correspondence is established between Nordsieck formulas and $k$-step formulas of order at least $k$, and a strong equivalence result is proved for all but certain pathological cases. Equivalence is also shown for $P(EC)^\ast E$ formulas but not for $P(EC)^\ast E$ formulas.},
